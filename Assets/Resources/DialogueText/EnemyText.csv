DebugEntity,Debug Entity,"This text should not appear as the Debug Entity is not supposed to appear in any battles or appear in the Bestiary. This could happen if the game fails to parse a certain EntityID as DebugEntity is the default in the enum (0). Although, you can also see this text by hacking or datamining the game. If you're a hacker or dataminer, then you should probably stop.","This doesn't look right, we should report this as a bug.","Oh, look. The game is broken. Sounds like someone didn't test the game enough for bugs.",I don't know what that is... Maybe something's wrong with the game?
Leafling,Leafling,"A small, common mammal native to the Verdant Forests, although they are also found in the Solar Grove.<line><line>Despite being small, they have a ravenous appetite. Travellers should steer clear of them so the Leaflings don't mistake them for a meal.","Leaflings are pretty weak, so you shouldn't have much trouble with them. Try not to let them chew on you if you can.",Leaflings are really annoying. All they do is chew on everything they see. Good thing they're easy to get rid of.,These cute little rascals love nibbling on everything they see.  Maybe we can keep one? I don't think Wilex would like that though.
Flowerling,Flowerling,"These relatives of Leaflings are known for their ability to fly. The propeller flowers on their heads are quite delicate, so attacking them will render the Flowerling unable to fly for the rest of battle.<line><line>Like regular Leaflings, they are constantly searching for an easy meal, so travellers should be careful around them.","Flowerlings can fly high enough that you need to jump on them. When you hit them, they'll fall down and won't be able to fly back up for the rest of battle.","It's pretty much just a flying Leafling. Once I stomp on it, the flower will break and it won't fly anymore.",I can't get high enough to reach it... Maybe Wilex can jump up to it?
Shrublet,Shrublet,"This variant of the Leafling is covered in rough thorns and has a stronger bite, although it has slightly lower health than regular Leaflings. A layer of thorns on their body makes it dangerous to come into contact with them.<line><line>It is advisable to try to attack them with weapons instead of making contact with them directly, despite how effective direct attacks may be.","Shrublets are covered in thorns, so you shouldn't stomp on them. Stomping will still hurt them, but you'll get hurt too. Make sure you hit them from a distance with your weapon.<next>You should focus on them first, since their bites are somewhat strong.","It's covered in thorns and has a pretty strong bite, so I better get rid of them first. Stomping on them is gonna hurt, but I might not have a choice. It'll hurt less than being chomped on, I guess.","Those thorns look pretty painful... I should try hitting them from a distance. Good thing I have a hammer! Their bites hurt a lot, so we should focus on getting rid of them first."
Rootling,Rootling,"The guardian of the Soul Crown in the Solar Grove, who is the young child of the previous guardian. While it is much weaker than the previous guardian, it is still quite large and powerful. Similar to Leaflings, the Rootling has a large appetite, made even larger by its massive size.<line><line>The Rootling will often dig underground to evade attackers, as well as to prepare for a stronger attack when it emerges.","This is the guardian of the Solar Grove. It doesn't look like you have a way around fighting it... When it hides underground, it's preparing to do a stronger attack, so that is your best time to heal or prepare yourself.","Looks like this is what's guarding the shrine in this place. Doesn't seem like it's that strong though. I can't hit it when it goes underground, so that's a good time to Focus.","Sorry we have to do this, but we really have to get through! When it goes underground, it looks like it's preparing for something big, so I should make sure we're ready for that."
Sunflower,Sunflower,"Sunflowers are stronger versions of Flowerlings that have flaming flowers. Their flowers are very good at absorbing sunlight, and that energy is used to fuel the flame. The flame can burn anyone trying to attack them directly.<line><line>Sunflowers rarely need to hunt for food as most of their energy comes from absorbing the sun's rays, yet they are still quite aggressive regardless. Unlike regular Flowerlings, they can quickly recover from being grounded.","This is a flaming version of normal Flowerlings. You'll get burned if you try to jump on them, so you should find another way to deal with them.<next>They're better at flying than normal Flowerlings, so hitting them down will only ground them until their next turn.","Flying and burning... That's a dangerous combination. If I stomp on them, they will come down, but I'll get burned if I do that.<next>Maybe I should try getting them down a different way...","I already have a hard time with flying things, but now this guy is burning too, so Wilex can't stomp on them without getting hurt. Maybe there's something I can do to get them down..."
Sunnybud,Sunnybud,"A stronger variation of Honeybuds that lives in the deeper parts of the Solar Grove. They are more adept at absorbing sunlight than Honeybuds, which gives them stronger attacks and better healing.<line><line>Their improved healing allows them to stay airborne after healing, and they can also get off the ground and heal on the same turn.","This is a Sunnybud, a stronger version of the Honeybud. They have stronger attacks and stronger healing. Unlike Honeybuds, hitting them down to the ground won't stop them from healing on their turn.","Looks like they can heal every turn, unlike Honeybuds. I can't even stop them from healing since they can get up and heal on the same turn.<next>I better get rid of them first so they stop that.","They really like sharing their honey with everyone. Why don't they share it with us? They can still heal even if they get hit down, so we should focus on them first."
Goldbush,Goldbush,"More aggressive than Brambleling? (lower HP but applies Illuminate to self (Hard mode: this boost move also applies Attack Boost)) (Also gets free regen so the lower hp is compensated by that) (Can roar to boost all allies with attack up 2 for 3 turns, applies Illuminate to self and attack boost in hard mode) (Has a 2 hit bite)","Goldbushes have natural regeneration, so you should focus on them one at a time. They can also boost their own attack and the attack of their allies, so you should take care of them first.","I better get rid of them first, since they'll keep boosting all our enemies attacks. They also have regeneration, so I should focus on them first.","It's pretty shiny but also pretty deadly. They make our enemies stronger, so we should get rid of it first."
MiracleBloom,Miracle Bloom,"The strongest and rarest variation of Honeybuds. They have extremely powerful healing and powerful attacks.<line><line>Like Sunnybuds, Miracle Blooms can heal their allies and still stay in the air, allowing them to heal their allies for multiple turns in a row. They can also get off the ground and heal on the same turn.<line><line>Miracle Blooms are the only source of the rare Miracle Syrup.","Miracle Blooms are the strongest form of Honeybuds. Their attacks are very strong, and they can heal their allies for a lot of HP.",Apparently their honey is really good at healing. Maybe I should take some for myself if I can. I should get rid of them first so they can't use it all up on their allies.,I bet their honey tastes really great. We'll have to focus on them first to get some though.
SunSapling,Sun Sapling,"The older form of the Rootling. At this stage of its life, the Sun Sapling rarely leaves the hole it buried itself in, although it can still leave it in emergencies.<line><line>The Sun Sapling gets most of its energy through absorbing sunlight through its leaves. This energy allows them to regenerate rapidly, and it can also share its energy with others to boost their power.<line><line>The Sun Sapling will also call forth other sun powered creatures to protect itself as well.","This is what the Rootling will grow up to be. Its leaves let it regenerate quickly and allows it to boost itself and its allies. It will keep calling allies as long as it's still alive.<next>If you're having trouble keeping up with doing more damage than it regenerates, then you chould try charging up to do all the damage you need to do as fast as possible.","It regenerates pretty fast and it keeps calling allies for help...Oh great. I should focus on doing damage faster than it can regenerate, or else we won't be getting anywhere.<next>One of the things it summons can heal it though, so I should get rid of them too.","Wow, it's so big! It looks like it can regenerate pretty fast and summon some friends every so often. Everything it summons is flying, so Wilex should handle them.<next>Then I should focus on making sure we do damage faster than it can heal itself, but I might need Wilex's help for that too."
Rockling,Rockling,"This is a rocky variant of the Leafling. Instead of being covered in leaves, this variant is covered with a rocky shell that gives them higher defense yet lower health. Outside of that, they are quite similar to regular Leaflings, as they still tend to bite anything that comes near them.","Rocklings are a version of Leaflings with a rocky shell instead of leaves covering them. The rock armor gives them some defense, but other than that they are the same as Leaflings.",Stomping won't do much against that rocky shell of theirs. I think slashing will still work though. Maybe I can try Focusing if that still isn't enough.,"It's covered in rocks, so stomping on it won't work. This looks like a job for my Hammer. Maybe I'll have to Power Smash if my hammer isn't doing enough."
Honeybud,Honeybud,"A variation of Flowerlings native to the Verdant Forest. The flower on its head produces honey, which it can use to heal its allies.<line><line>Healing allies is a strenuous process, which renders them grounded for a short time. They are also incapable of healing from the ground.<line><line>Unlike Flowerings, they can quickly get up off the ground on their turn. The honey can also be extracted to use as a food source.","Honeybuds can fly and heal their allies using the flower on their head. Like with Flowerlings, you can hit them to make them fall down, but they can fly back up on their turn.<next>When they're in the air, they can heal their allies with honey, but they fall down after healing.","It's a flying healer, so I better focus on it first. They can't heal from the ground, so I should keep them down.<next>Sharing their honey will make them fall down, but they can get back up again pretty quickly.","The honey they make seems tasty, but they only share it with their own allies, so I should probably stop that.<next>There's not a lot I can do while they're flying, but they fall down every time they heal. Then it's my time to strike!"
BurrowTrap,Burrow Trap,"Burrow Traps are carnivorous plants that can burrow down and come up in different places. They often try to take their prey by surprise, by emerging right next to them. Pollen from their bites makes their prey dizzy, making it harder for them to escape or fight back.<line><line>If they are attacked, they will retaliate with an attack stronger and faster than normal. Killing them won't stop them from countering, as they will get one last hit before dying.","Burrow Traps attack by biting you and covering you in pollen. The pollen makes you Dizzy for a short time, so you probably want to take care of them first if you aren't good at blocking.<next>However, they will retaliate whenever you hit them, so you should try to use your strongest attacks on them to get rid of them more quickly. They will always be able to make at least one counter attack though, no matter how hard you hit them.","They really want to get their pollen in our eyes, and they also counter when they get hit, so I should hit them as hard as I can. But even if I do that, they'll still get one more counter in before they die.","Yuck! They really like getting their pollen everywhere! That pollen makes it hard for us to see, and they will also fight back when we hit them. Let's give them everything we got!"
Sundew,Sundew,"Sundews are strange plants that produce sticky poison droplets on the ends of their tentacles. They will lob these droplets at anyone who gets near them.<line><line>Attacking them will also cause them to retaliate, so care must be taken when trying to remove them. Killing them won't stop them from fighting back, as they will get one last attack in.","Sundews attack by fling sticky droplets towards you. Those droplets inflict Poison, so you should try your best to avoid them.<next>Attacking them will make them retaliate, so you should try to use your strongest attacks on them to get rid of them more quickly. They will always be able to make at least one counter attack though, no matter how hard you hit them.","I better avoid those poison droplets they keep throwing around. They strike back when they get hurt, so I should hit them as hard as I can. But even if I kill them in one hit, they still get one last counter attack.","I really don't want that poison in my fur, so I should try avoiding their attacks. They fight back when they get hit though, so I should hit them as hard as possible."
Leafswimmer,Leafswimmer,Leafswimmers attack with Light attacks and they can use Astral Wall on themselves. ,Leafswimmers attack with Light attacks and they can use Astral Wall on themselves. It may be better to leave them for last as it can be difficult to get through it.,"It can shield itself, so I should get rid of them before they can do that. Dark attacks are stronger against them, so those are my best plan.","I can't use Earth or Light damage on them, but Dark damage is their weakness so I should use that."
Brambleling,Brambleling,"Bulky, healthy versions of normal Leaflings. They can soften their leaves to slow down damage dealt to them. They can also roar to boost the defense of all their allies.",Bramblelings are bulky versions of Leaflings. They can soften their leafy shell while boosting the defense of everyone.,"They can boost our allies defense, so we should get rid of them first. They can soften their leaves to make that annoying though.","It's covered in fluffy leaves, and they can soften themselves while making all their friends more defensive."
GiantVine,Giant Vine,"A massive vine summoned by the Master of Autumn. The powerful earth magic coursing through it gives it massive strength, allowing it to pick up and restrain those that would harm the Master. However, it always takes some preparation for it to grab someone, meaning that there is always an opportunity to prevent someone from being grabbed. If someone is grabbed by the vine, they will be restrained until the vine is destroyed or the person dies.","This large vine can slam into you but it can also grab you after a short time. The vine seems to have a short delay before trying to grab someone, so that's when you should really focus your attention on them.","It's definitely looking at me funny, even though it doesn't even have eyes. I better cut it down before it tries anything. Luna better get me out if I get grabbed by this thing...","That's one big vine! It looks like it's strong enough to pick us up, so we should get rid of it before it can do that. Hopefully Wilex will save me if I get grabbed."
Solardew,Solardew,Solardews are stronger forms of Sundews. They can heal their allies and Illuminate them. Their counter attack hits twice with Light and Earth element.,Solardews can toss Light balls and counter with a 2 hit attack.

They can also heal and Illuminate their allies.,They toss Light balls at us and counter with a 2 hit attack. They can also heal and Illuminate their allies.
VinePlatform,Vine Platform,"A stiff bundle of vines sturdy enough to stand on, an example of Sycamore's plant manipulation powers. While the vines can't attack on their own, they help Sycamore use stronger abilities than he would have on the ground.","It's a platform made from magical vines. It can't do much of anything on its own, but you should still bring it down since Sycamore is stronger while standing on it.","It's just a platform, so it can't really do much. Sycamore is stronger on top of it, so I better cut it down soon.","The platform can't do much on its own, but breaking it will make Sycamore fall down. I can't reach him when he's high up so I'll have to break the platform."
Sycamore,Sycamore,"Sycamore is a man of principle, with deep reverence for the messages the forest sends him. If the forest tells him to tear down a settlement, he will do that without hesitation.<line><line>His family naturally has plant related magic, and so they naturally have leadership over those aligned with the Stonewood Temple.","This is Sycamore, one of the leaders of Stonewood Temple. He has the power to manipulate plants to attack. Once he is hurt enough, he will summon some plant allies to help him and he will stand on a raised vine platform.<next>You should try to get him down if you can, since he has stronger attacks while on that platform.","He must've gone crazy, thinking the plants are talking to him. Either that, or he's just making that up for an excuse to do whatever he wants. Anyway, he has plant magic which lets him attack us with plants or summon plants to fight for him.<next>When he gets hurt enough, he'll get up onto a vine platform that we'll need to cut down.",LunaDefault_Sycamore
VineThrone,Vine Throne,"A massive vine throne summoned by the Master of Autumn. The vines on top form a protective shell around the one on the throne, making it impossible to target the one inside without destroying the throne first.","The Vine Throne protects the Master of Autumn from all attacks. You will need to destroy it to get to him. However, you shouldn't ignore the Giant Vines since they can grab you and take you out of the fight.",Nothing can get to the Master of Autumn while this Throne is around. I'll have to cut it down fast. But I should make sure the Giant Vines don't grab me before I can destroy it...,"The Throne keeps the Master of Autumn safe from all attacks, so we need to get rid of it to get to him. But those Giant Vines are also pretty dangerous, so I'll have to get rid of them too."
MasterOfAutumn,Master of Autumn,"Where spring is seen as a season of growth and beginnings, autumn is seen as a season of death and endings. Sycamore's responsibilities are a reflection of that, as he is the one who ensures that the plants and animals of the forest do not die unnecessarily, being the one who fights those who would defile the forest.<line><line> His plant manipulation power has become much stronger, allowing him to summon massive vines in order to attack and trap anyone who would attack him. The throne he summons will fully protect him from any harm, and also give him access to stronger attacks.","This is a form of Sycamore empowered by the magic of the seasons. It looks like he can summon much stronger vines to defend himself, being able to summon Giant Vines and a Vine Throne.<next>Like his original form, he is much stronger while on the Vine Throne, so make sure you destroy the throne as fast as you can.<next>However, the Giant Vines can grab you and take you out of the fight, so you will need to destroy them quickly as well.","This guy can summon vines like last time, but they're a lot bigger now. The platform he makes will make him impossible to attack, so I better cut that down when he summons it. But I should also pay attention to the giant vines he summons too, since those can pick us up.",LunaDefault_Harvestborn
Bandit,Bandit,"These frogs have large ears, allowing them to notice potential targets from further away. Regular bandits like these use short swords as their signature weapon, and they often try to catch their targets off guard with a feint before they strike. Bandits have a strong sense of comradery, always looking out for each other, making sure their spoils are divided fairly.","I've had a few too many encounters with these bandits. They roam the desert preying upon anyone who isn't one of them. Make sure you pay attention to their attacks, since they may try to fake you out.","They picked the wrong guy to mess with. They can do a fake out with their swords, so I should watch out for that.","We're not gonna let them get a hand on our stuff! Their swords are pretty hard to keep track of, so I gotta pay close attention to them."
Renegade,Renegade,"Spiky frogs usually become outcasts due to their threatening appearance. Pointy spines all over their back and head make it dangerous to get too close to them, while also giving them some defense. They also have sharp claws for attacking, and they can sometimes use a two hit attack.<line><line>Most spiky frogs tend not to wear much clothing, since most clothing would be torn up by the spines on their back.","Renegades have higher health and defense than normal frogs thanks to their spiky backs. Those spikes make them dangerous to stomp on, so you should hit them from a distance.<next>They can attack by slashing with their claws, sometimes hitting twice instead of once.","All those spikes give them some defense, so I might need to Focus to get through that. They can do a double slash with their claws, so I should block that if I can.","Those spikes are pretty menacing, so I should use my hammer on them. I might need to do some Power Smashes since their defense is pretty high."
Sentry,Sentry,"Sentries are frogs with the ability to inflate themselves and fly. They become electrified while airborne, so it is a good idea to attack them from a distance.<line><line>They attack by slinging rocks from above. Attacking them will provoke a paralyzing counter attack. Sentries usually focus their attention on the most vulnerable targets.","These frogs can blow themselves up like balloons to fly in the air, and they become electrified while airborne. They attack by tossing rocks at you with slings, but they will try to aim at whoever has the lowest health.<next>They can also counter attacks made against them with a paralyzing rock, so you should hit them with strong attacks to defeat them quickly.","They always try to hit whoever's weakest, unless they're doing a counter attack. Taking them down is pretty hard since they're electrified when they're blown up, and electric attacks don't even work on them.<next>I'll also have to deal with their paralyzing counter attack if I get them down.","They look so funny when they're all blown up, but they get electrified when they do that. Maybe there's a way I can hit them without getting hurt myself?<next>Hitting them will make them hit back with a paralyzing rock, so I better be careful of that."
Cactupole,Cactupole,"These strange creatures inflate themselves in order to disguise themselves as floating cacti. Cactupoles have electrified skin when they fly, making them dangerous to come into contact with.<line><line>They have a lot of difficulty moving while inflated, so they have to deflate themselves to attack.<line><line>Their main predators are Sandswimmers, who can sense the electric fields they give off.","These tadpoles have hard skin and thorns that give them high defense and makes them look like cacti. They can inflate themselves to fly, and their attacks are more dangerous when they're in the air, since they can paralyze you.<next>However, they have to come down to attack you, so you can try to wait for that time to strike. Their thorns make them dangerous to jump on, so be careful when dealing with them.","A flying cactus... Seems annoying to deal with. At least they'll fall down to the ground when they attack, so I should wait for that to happen.","I thought it was a normal cactus for a moment... Getting hit by their thorns will paralyze us, so we should try to avoid that. When they're flying I can't do too much to them, but they'll come down on their own, so I should wait for that."
Sandswimmer,Sandswimmer,"Sandswimmers are strange mammals that can swim through the sand like water. Their large bills allow them to sense electrical fields, which helps lead them towards potential food sources.<line><line>Their electrified skin makes them shocking to the touch, and also makes them immune to electrical attacks. The bandits in the desert occasionally use tamed Sandswimmers to help chase down their targets.","Sandswimmers are bulky beasts with high health but low attack. Try not to get bitten by them, since their bites can paralyze you. Their electrified skin gives them some defense and makes them immune to electrical attacks themselves.<next>You shouldn't stomp on them, since you'll get shocked on contact.","These big beasts have pretty weak attacks, but they can paralyze us with their bites. They have shocking skin, which gives them a little bit of defense and makes them immune to electricity. Looks like I should use my sword for this one.","They move so fast... I wonder what it's like to ride one? That's probably a bad idea though, since their skin is shocking. They can also paralyze us with their bites, so we should be careful of that."
SpireGuard,Spire Guard,"Spire guards protect the city of Windspire from the bandits using their rapiers, and they serve under Mayor Halberd. They are strong in groups as they can rally each other to make each other stronger.","Spire guards are usually found around Windspire. They fight with rapiers and they can rally each other to boost their attack, so picking them off one at a time can make them weaker.","They can boost each other, so picking them off one at a time is a good idea.","They can boost each other, so we should take care of them one at a time."
EliteGuard,Elite Guard,"Elite guards undergo difficult training that makes them very formidible spear fighters. Relatively few master their techniques so they are usually only seen guarding the most important areas of Windspire, including parts of Halberd's mansion. Elite guards can send waves of water at their opponents and protect them.","The elite guards of Windspire use different kinds of spear moves to fight. They can stab you twice, send water waves at you or protect themselves and others.",They keep waving their spears around at us to fight. If I get rid of them first they can't keep their allies defense up.,They're twirling around their spear like it's nothing! Maybe I should switch to using one?

DesertBloom,Desert Bloom,"Desert Blooms are the rarest form of Honeybuds, even rarer than the elusive Miracle Blooms. Unfortunately for those seeking rare honey from them, their flower only produces ordinary Flower Syrup. Their hustling abilities seem to be come from magic they have. Desert Blooms can shift their position to hide behind enemies with more health, or hide low health enemies behind themselves.","This is a Desert Bloom, the rarest form of the Honeybud. Their attacks are very strong, and they can heal their allies for a lot of HP and Hustle them.<next>They can also switch places with other enemies to hide behind ones with more health, or to go in front of ones with less.","Apparently their honey is really good at healing and it makes their allies faster. But it looks like Flower Syrup, so I don't know how that works.<next>They can also switch places with other enemies to hide behind ones with more health, or to go in front of ones with less.","I bet their honey tastes really great. Their honey makes their allies move faster though, so taking care of them first is a good idea.<next>They can also switch places with other enemies to hide behind ones with more health, or to go in front of ones with less."
Goldpole,Goldpole,"A golden version of Brightpoles. Goldpoles are more aggressive but have lower defense and health than Brightpoles. Goldpoles can quickly zap enemies, so fighting them is often a race against the clock. They can Supercharge and Focus themselves on their actual turns.","Goldpoles are faster versions of Brightpoles. They can act after each of your actions. During their real turn, they will Focus and Supercharge themselves.","They get a turn every time we move, so I better get rid of them first. They also charge themselves on their normal turn too so I shouldn't waste any time in dealing with them.","They fly so high and move so fast? Wilex should deal with them, I'm not very good at dealing with flying things and they get a free turn whenever either of us move."
Shockworm,Shockworm,Shockworm bites can arc between their enemies and they can also charge themselves or match the focus of others. They are weak to Fire damage.,"They can bite you do deal Air/Electric damage. That attack will also arc between you, so pay attention to that. They can also charge themselves to give themselves Supercharge and they can also copy the Focus of the other enemies.<next>They are weak to Fire damage.","They're weak to Fire damage, so a Flame Stomp is good for getting rid of them. They can give themselves Focus or copy the Focus of the others so I should get rid of them before they can do that.","Fire damage is their weakness, so I can try a Flame Smash when they're down. They can give themselves Focus or copy the Focus of the others so I should get rid of them before they can do that."

DesertBossGuy,Flight,"The leader of the desert bandits. His family once all lived in Windspire, but now his family is split, with half of them following Flight in becoming a part of the bandits.<line><line>Flight plans on using the Storm Cannon to take control of Windspire.",KeruDefault_DesertBossGuy,WilexDefault_DesertBossGuy,LunaDefault_DesertBossGuy
StormCannon,Storm Cannon,"An ancient weapon used to bring the Air Dragon, Electrion out of the sky. It shoots out the electrical energy stored within to attack, and it can draw some energy from the environment.<line><line>However, the energy used to bring down Electrion came from the dragon himself, and so after his death there is now no way for the cannon to reach its maximum potential. Although, the power of the Air Core can still charge the cannon enough to be devastating.",KeruDefault_StormCannon,"It's a big hunk of metal that shoots lightning at us. We're probably better off focusing on taking down Flight, since this thing has a lot of defense and higher health than him.",LunaDefault_StormCannon
Stormtamer,Stormtamer,"Stormhole began as a group of outcasts who were rejected and forced out of the cities in the desert. As they didn't have the favor of Electrion, most of them had to scavenge and steal supplies from traders in the desert in order to survive, giving rise to the Stormhole Bandits. The ultimate robbery of theirs would be to kill Electrion and take his power for themselves. The bandits built a cannon capable of using the great dragon's power against him, and struck him down with ease. Unfortunately, his death would render most of their settlement uninhabitable due to the energy he released, as well as the eternal storms that now perpetually surround Stormhole.",KeruDefault_Stormtamer,WilexDefault_Stormtamer,LunaDefault_Stormtamer
Stormkiller,Stormkiller,"The ancient cannon, now charged with an immense amount of energy. It takes some time to charge up, with the charging being interruptable. However, it can fortify itself, making it very difficult to prevent its ultimate attack from being used. The ultimate attack is unavoidable and impossible to survive, so interrupting its charge is crucial to defeating it.","Whatever you do, you must NOT let the cannon fire. Keep hitting it to reduce its level of charge. Its defense will increase every turn, so you need to defeat the cannon or the Stormtamer as fast as you can.","There's a lot of energy in that thing. Getting hit by it will probably kill us, so I need to stop it from firing by hitting it hard. Electric attacks won't work since it will just absorb them.<next>Still, we're better off trying to take down the guy on top since the cannon has a lot more defense than him.<next>We need to be fast about this fight, since this thing will keep getting more defense every turn, so eventually we won't be able to stop it from firing anymore.","It's bright and sparking, but that's probably a bad thing. I don't think I want this thing to fire on us, so I think we should keep hitting it so it won't attack."
TrainingDummy,Dummy,"An ordinary training dummy. This dummy has been around from the very beginning of the Tournament , and yet it appears almost completely undamaged.","It's a normal training dummy. I don't think you need to worry about breaking it, since the other Tournament fighters probably used it before.","Just a normal training dummy... It can survive anything we throw at it though. We don't need any training though, so we don't need this thing.","Did they have to give it a cute face like that? I feel kinda bad attacking it... Well it doesn't seem to mind, so I think it should be fine."
TrainingDummyBoss,Dummy?,"It seems that the dummy was inhabited by a magical spirit deep within it. The immense power of the spirit kept the dummy from being damaged, but the spirit would lay dormant until someone peered deep inside the dummy to awaken it.<line><line>The existence of this spirit raises an important question: Are there others like it hiding elsewhere in the world?","What!? How did I not see this power before? Okay, it looks like whatever possessed the dummy can't move around, so if you run away, it can't stop you. You need to get out of there, I don't see any way you could win this.","I knew there was something wrong with the face of this thing... It has more HP than anything else we've fought, so this is going to take a while. If we run away, it can't follow us, but I won't back down. We just have to fight like we've never fought before!","How strong is this guy? He has more HP than anyone else we've fought, so we'll have to fight harder than we've ever fought before! It can't catch us if we run away, but who knows what he could do if we left him alone?"
TournamentPawn,Boulder,"Boulder has always lived in the shadow of his older siblings, and so he has always wanted to prove himself stronger than them by carving his own path. However, his time in the tournament has been a long string of losses with only a small handful of victories, keeping him at the bottom of the rankings. His determination hasn't been shaken by this however, and so he is willing to give it his all to finally rise above the bottom and defeat someone.","Boulder's losing streak is impressive, as much as it is sad. You would think that a losing streak like that would humble him, but he is very stubborn and arrogant, unwilling to change his fighting style or improve.","He keeps using the same stomping attack over and over. No wonder he's losing every time. But I guess he has some pretty strong dedication, I probably would have dropped out of the tournament if I lost as much as he has.","Poor guy... Maybe we should let him win this one. No? Well, it doesn't look like he'll do anything other than stomp us, so this should be a simple fight."
TournamentKnight,Lance,"Lance is an eccentric fighter who relies a lot on his agility, being able to dodge a lot of his opponent's attacks, and also being able to attack very suddenly. While he may not be able to survive many hits against himself, a fluke upset against some of the higher ranking fighters has shown that his style isn't something that can be taken lightly.",KeruDefault_TournamentKnight,"It's hard to land a hit on him, so I'll have to pay attention to his stance. He gets a turn every time we move, so we should just keep trying to hit him as hard as we can.","So fast... He keeps zipping around to dodge my attacks. Maybe I can try to catch him off guard by attacking a certain way? He gets to attack every time we move, so we should just try to keep attacking him every turn."

Some thought that this was due to corruption, as her brother is the mayor of Windspire. Yet this is likely not the case, as Halberd appears to have little to no interest in the tournament.

TournamentChampion,Summit,"The original champion of the Windspire Tournament. He left the tournament soon after the very first two person team entered the tournament.  From his perspective, allowing teams to compete would let weaklings take the title of Champion. His anger at this change reached its height when he was defeated by a team and lost his title for the first time after he got it. After winning his title back, he would disappear, taking the Champion Ribbon with him.","He's the original champion of the tournament. Even after all this time in hiding, he still hits extremely hard. You will need to watch his attacks closely, as they will do a lot more damage if you fail to block them.<next>He also has the ability to block your attacks if you don't do them correctly.<next>His fighting style is one where he often does massive attacks that make him need to recover after doing them, so you should use that downtime to prepare yourself for his next moves.","""Real champion""? Yeah, right. Like you're anything but a coward for hiding up here. He hits hard, but blocking works better than normal against his attacks. If I mess up my attacks, he'll block them completely too.<next>After his bigger moves he'll take some time to recover, so I should watch out for those.","He looks a lot bigger than his brother, but he's been staying up here alone for a long time. I'll need to stay focused, since all his attacks will hurt a lot more if I don't block.<next>He'll even block my attacks if I mess them up too. His bigger attacks make him tired when he does them, so maybe that's a good time to heal myself."
Slime,Slime,"A very common creature in the Gemstone Islands. They are naturally curious, so they will usually approach anyone who comes near them. Anything they're curious about ends up being covered in slime, since they often jump into things to get a better look at them. Attacking them splits off a smaller version of themselves.","Slimes are pretty weak, but they have two different ways of stomping. Their higher stomp will deal Water damage while their lower stomp does normal damage. They are somewhat weak to electrical attacks.<next>Attacking them will split off a smaller version of themselves with less health, so using strong attacks on them can avoid that.","These little guys don't look very strong, but they can still stomp us pretty hard. Electricity is their weakness, so it's a good time for an Electro Stomp.<next>I should try to beat them in one hit, or else they will split off a smaller slime with less health.","Slimes like jumping around. Sometimes they jump low, but sometimes they can jump really high to hit us harder. Maybe I can learn something from them about jumping?<next>Hitting them splits off a cute mini slime, so I should try to beat them in one hit."
Slimewalker,Slimewalker,"A Slime that has taken a form similar to the jellyfish in the Gemstone Islands. They can launch slime balls at their enemies, which will hit the one who will take more damage from it.","These slimes look like the jellyfish in the Gemstone Islands, and they sometimes try to mimic them. They can attack by slashing with a sharp tentacle or by shooting a slime ball.<next>Their slime ball attack will target the one that will take the most damage from it, so defensive boosts may not be helpful here.","It looks like a jellyfish, but it's actually just another slime. They can slash us or shoot slime balls at us. They must be pretty smart, since they will shoot their slime at whichever of us will take the most damage.<next>Electric attacks are their weakness, so I should try using those against them.",It looks like a slimy jellyfish. They can slash at us or shoot water balls.
Slimeworm,Slimeworm,"A strange creature that anchors itself in place to draw nutrients from the ground. They are almost never seen outside of their anchored state. They launch water bombs out of their tail in order to defend themselves. Their attacks are quite slow, requiring a full turn to prepare themselves to fire.","Slimeworms are large creatures that draw nutrients from the ground to empower themselves. They can charge to give themselves Focus and Absorb, and they will shoot large slime balls after charging.<next>They also have thick skin that gives them high defense. However, they are weak to Earth damage.","These worms have high defense, so I probably need to Focus to be able to hit them hard enough. It looks like these guys have the same idea, since they keep doing charge attacks.","They're too tall for me to stomp on, so I'll have to use my hammer on them. I might have to Power Smash them since their defense is pretty high. They seem weak to Earth damage though, so maybe that's another way to beat them."
Slimebloom,Slimebloom,"A strange flower-like creature made of slime. Similar to Slimeworms, they anchor themselves in place to draw nutrients from the ground. However, they have weaker attacks since they are much smaller. They will attack by throwing balls of water at their target or by firing a lightning bolt at them. Their tentacles are electrified, making direct contact with them dangerous. However, they are weak to Paralyze despite being covered in electricity.","They are not actually flowers, but they still draw energy from the ground. You should be careful to block their attacks, since they can paralyze you or put you to sleep.<next>Their tentacles are also electrified, so you shouldn't stomp on them. Strangely, they are weak to being paralyzed despite being immune to electricity.","Weird looking flowers... Those tentacles are electrified so electrical attacks won't work on them. They can paralyze us if we're not careful, and they can also lob sleepy slime at us.<next>We better get rid of them fast so they can't paralyze us or put us to sleep. They're weak to being paralyzed, so maybe we should give them a taste of their own medicine.","I can't tell if these are flowers or not... Getting a closer look is probably a bad idea since I'll get shocked by their tentacles. They can zap and paralyze us, and they can also lob slime balls at us to put us to sleep.<next>We should get rid of them so they can't do that."
SirenFish,Siren Fish,"These strange fish are always covered in slime, which often forms into bubbles that they use to fly and attack. This is an adaptation to avoid predators, since there aren't any flying predators within the Gemstone Islands or the oceans they usually inhabit. They often sing songs, which can put their enemies to sleep or make their allies stronger.","These fish can fly using bubbles created from the slime on their skin. Their main attack is blowing sedative bubbles at you. They can also empower all their allies, so you should take care of them quickly.<next>However, they can't boost their allies if they're grounded, so that is another way to stop them from boosting everyone.","They're covered in slime... Shouldn't they be called ""Slimefish""? The bubbles they blow can put us to sleep, and they can also sing a song that boosts all their allies. They can't sing while on the ground so I better get them down when I can.","It looks like a flying worm, but apparently it's a fish of some kind. They can put us to sleep with their bubbles, or sing songs that can make their allies stronger. Looks like Wilex will have to get them down, since I have a hard time hitting flying things."
Urchiling,Urchiling,"Urchilings are very slow attackers, but their charge can also give themselves Astral Wall which makes it harder to prevent them from getting their charge attack done.","Urchilings charge up water attacks on both of you. They give themselves Astral Wall when they charge up, which makes it harder to stop their charge atatacks.",They charge up big water attacks but give themselves Astral Wall when they charge up so it's hard to stop them.,They're covered in spikes but they don't attack very fast. Hurting them might be hard since they give themselves Astral Wall when they charge up.
GoldenSlime,Golden Slime,"The rarest and the strongest of the slime types, Golden slimes are capable of mimicing others abilities or copying the forms of others. Golden Slimes can also invert enemy effects or extend their allies effects and heal them.",Golden slimes can copy moves from their allies or even turn into them. They can also splash you with Air/Electric damage and invert your effects or give their allies regeneration and extend their effects.,Golden slimes can turn into other enemies or copy their moves. They can also invert our effects or give their allies regeneration.,They're shiny but they can copy our other enemies moves or even turn into them. They can also invert our effects or give each other regeneration.
ElementalSlime,Elemental Slime,"Elemental slimes are immune to normal damage but weak to all elements and ailments. They apply buffs to others and can give allies Focus, Astral Wall or healing. They attack in a splash attack then single attack pattern for their elemental moves.","Elemental slimes are immune to normal damage, but weak to any other element. They can hit you with spread and stomp elemental attacks of any element, and their moves can also heal their allies or apply Focus or Astral Wall.",Elemental slimes have a lot of different elemental attacks. They can also heal or buff their allies so we shouldn't ignore them.,"They splash us with elemental damage, but they can get hurt by elemental stuff too."
NormalSlime,Normal Slime,"Normal slimes can resist all negative effects and elemental damage. Both of their attacks will cleanse positive effects from you, but their spread attack also inflicts Exhaust.","Normal slimes are immune to everything but normal damage, and they can also erase your buffs when they hit you.","They get rid of our buffs, and they can exhaust us. Nothing but normal damage can hurt them also.","You can't hurt them with anything but normal damage, so I guess that's what we're gonna do. They can get rid of our buffs and Exhaust us too, so we shouldn't ignore them."
SoftSlime,Soft Slime,"Soft slimes only take 1 damage from attacks but have relatively low health. They can heal their allies or give their allies Soften. Soft Slimes can only heal allies one at a time, so spread attacks are useful against them.","These fluffy slimes can only take 1 damage from your attacks, but you only need a few of them to defeat them. They can stomp on their allies to heal them or give them Soften.<next>Since they can only heal one at a time, spread attacks are good at dealing with them.","The stuff they're made of makes it hard to cut through them, anything I do only does 1 damage at a time. They can jump on others to heal them, so spread attacks can stop that.","It's hard to get a good hit on them so they only take one damage at a time, but they don't hve much health anyway. They jump on their allies to heal them, so spread attacks can stop that."
RigidSlime,Rigid Slime,"Rigid slimes can only take lehal damage. They use single target attacks or give themselves Quantum Shield. If left alone for too long, they can split into two with less health, which may be the only way to beat them if you don't have many high damage attacks.","Rigid slimes attack by jumping on you or by charging up for a bigger jump. Their stiff bodies will make them immune to any attack that doesn't kill them outright, but they can split themselves into two if they're left for too long.","They jump on us normally or charge up big jumps. Weak hits do nothing against them, but one strong hit will break them completely. They'll split apart if left alone for too long, so if we can't beat them normally that is another way to deal with them.","They jump at us or charge up bigger jumps. If we leave them alone, they'll split into two so we can wait if we can't hurt them.<next>Hitting them won't do anything unless we hit them hard enough to beat them in one hit."

Blazecrest,Blazecrest,"Blazecrests are the strongest of the Flamecrests. They use their natural capabilities to fight enemies, seeing weapon users as weaklings who can't really fight. Their scales give them some defense, but they are weak to water attacks. The burning crests on their head and their burning clothing means that direct attacks will burn you. Blazecrests often see themselves as the ideal form of Flamecrests, since they are the strongest and have the strongest fire breath.<line><line>Their main attack is breathing a massive stream of fire to hit all their enemies at once. They can also roar at enemies to make them Berserk.","Blazecrests use their strong fire breath to hurt you, but they can also roar at you to make you Berserk.<next>They have higher health than other Flamecrests, but they have the same water weakness most other Blazecrests have, so water is the best way to beat them.","Their heads are on fire, so obviously water attacks are the way to go here. I should beat them first because their fire breath is pretty strong, and their roar attack can make us Berserk.","These hotheads are always looking to pick a fight! A bit of water should help them cool off, so we should try using that kind of attack."
Embercrest,Embercrest,"Embercrests are not as strong as Blazecrests and have much weaker fire breath, only being able to produce smaller fireballs instead of a massive stream of flame. They have more defense than Blazecrests but they still have the same water weakness. Embercrests are the majority of the Flamecrest population, making up roughly 50% of them.<line><line>They tend to use a sword in addition to their fiery attacks to fight enemies. They usually slash twice with their sword attacks.","Embercrests have some defense and they use their swords to attack. They use a dual slash pattern to attack, but they can also shoot a fireball to hit someone with Fire damage.<next>Embercrests have the same water weakness most other Flamecrests have, so try using water on them if you can.","Two swords... Don't they know one is enough? They can use both swords to attack or they can shoot fireballs at us. That armor they're wearing gives them some defense too. Water attacks are a good idea, but poison also works on them.","The armor they're wearing gives them some defense, but they're still weak to Water like almost everything else in the Caldera. They attack by slashing us or by shooting fireballs at us."
Ashcrest,Ashcrest,"Ashcrests are the weakest of the Flamecrests. Unlike other Flamecrests, they are not weak to water, but they are slightly weak to fire attacks instead. Ashcrests are often looked down upon by other Flamecrests because they can't breathe fire at all, and often times their crests aren't even on fire.<line><line>They tend to rely on bomb attacks since they are quite weak physically.","Ashcrests have the lowest health and defense of Flamecrests, but they don't have the same water weakness of other Flamecrests. They are actually slightly weak to fire damage though.<next>They use shock bombs and water bombs to attack instead of attacking directly.","Sneaky little guys... They can't breathe fire, but the bombs they throw are pretty annoying.

Heatwing,Heatwing,"Heatwings are fiercely territorial, so they will attack anyone unfamiliar who intrudes on their territory. Their main attacks are swooping down on targets or flapping their wings to burn a large area with their burning wings. Like  many other fiery creatures, water attacks are especially effective against them.","Heatwings are flying reptiles with burning wings.

Lavaswimmer,Lavaswimmer,"These large reptiles have perpetually burning scales on their backs that make it dangerous to jump on them. Domesticated Lavaswimmers are often used as a source of leather, meat and eggs. However, wild Lavaswimmers often have stronger flames on their backs, which are better suited for making the infinitely burning leather that inhabitants of the Caldera wear.","Lavaswimmers are covered in burning scales that make it dangerous to come into contact with them. This is their main defense mechanism, as their attacks are somewhat weak. They can bite you and they can also shoot fireballs at you.<next>They aren't weak to water, but electric attacks are very effective against them, so that is a good way to beat them.","They have pretty weak attacks, but they can shoot fireballs at us.

Shrouder,Shrouder,"A spore creature that has absorbed some of the illusory power of the Shrouded Valley. This allows them to hide their allies from attacks. These creatures are mostly hollow on the inside, making them buoyant enough to fly.<line><line>They attack by spreading large clouds of spores to weaken enemies. They can only shroud their allies while airborne, so grounding them is a good way to prevent that.","These are one of the more insidious creatures of the Shrouded Valley. Shrouders can hide their allies from your attacks, and they can blow clouds of spores that make it harder to use skills.<next>Make sure you remove them first or else you'll be fighting an uphill battle.",Shrouders can hide our enemies from attacks and blow dark clouds that make it harder for us to move. I better get rid of it first so it won't slow us down.,It's flying up high and it can hide all our enemies from us. Wilex should take it out first so that won't happen.
HoarderFly,Hoarder Fly,"These creatures can convert the dark energy of the Valley into healing light, but they hoard this energy instead of using it for the most part. Their bites actually heal their targets by a small amount, but their bites also inject strong venom as well.<line><line>Hoarder Flies are commonly hunted for food as they are one of the few non-fungal creatures in the Shrouded Valley.","Hoarder Flies have healing magic, but they almost never use it willingly. Their bites will heal you for a small amount, but their bites have some venom that will poison you. They can also swoop down on you multiple times to do damage normally.","Apparently they have healing abilities, but they usually keep it all to themselves, which is pretty good for us. They will fight pretty viciously to defend themselves though.<next>Their bites heal us a tiny amount but also poisons us, and they can also swoop down on us multiple times. We should get rid of it first so it can't poison us.","They're one of the few light sources down in the Valley, but they're still pretty dangerous. Their bites heal us a little bit but give us strong Poison. They can also swoop down on us multiple times as their attack."
Mosquito,Mosquito,"Mosquitos distrust almost everyone they come across, due to their fear of the spore zombies in the Shrouded Valley. A spore infection causes the target to act slightly differently than they normally do, so mosquitos are hyper vigilant for small behavior changes in those they know. Outsiders can't become spore zombies, but Mosquitoes are still paranoid around them. Their weapons of choice are needles, which they use to weaken opponents. They can also drain health from opponents by biting them, and they usually target the one who looks healthiest.","Mosquitoes will try to bite you and suck your blood to heal themselves, but they also have a needle to defend themselves with. Their needle will Paralyze you as well as inflict Sunder which will lower your defense.<next>They tend to target whoever looks healthiest when they're looking for someone to bite. You should take care of them quickly, so they don't heal back the damage you do to them.","Bloodsuckers... They drain our blood to heal themselves, and they try to bite whoever looks healthiest. They also have needles they can use to Paralyze us and lower our defense.<next>Luna doesn't do well around needles, so I should probably help her out with this one.","Why do they have to like needles so much? They can Paralyze and lower our defense with their needles, or suck our blood with their big needle mouth. Okay, I can do this, I just have to take care of them before they can heal themselves too much."
Toxiwing,Toxiwing,Toxiwings have toxic wings and attacks by draining health from enemies or by swooping down to deal Fire element and give themselves Counter Flare.,Toxiwings attack by draining health from you or by swooping down and burning you and giving Counter Flre to themselves. Their health drain attack targets the healthier of you two while the swoop attack targets the least healthy of you.,"They drain our blood to heal themselves, and they try to bite whoever looks healthiest. They can also swoop down on whoever is the least healthiest to do fire damage and give themselves Counter Flare.",They have needle beaks and can suck our blood through them. Yuck! They'll probably be after me more often since they like to hit whoever is healthiest. They can also swoop on us to do fire dmage and give themselves Counter Flare.
GoldFly,Gold Fly,"Gold flies don't have the same healing as Hoarder Flies, but they can strengthen themselves whenever their allies die. They can blow golden wind to deal Air/Electric damage, and they can bite to apply Sunder.","Gold flies don't have the same healing as Hoarder Flies, but they can strengthen themselves whenever their allies die. They can blow golden wind to deal Air/Electric damage, and they can bite to apply Sunder.","They can blow electric wind at us or bite us to make us weaker.<next>They get stronger whenever any other enemy dies, so we should get rid of it first so it can't get any stronger.","They're really bright, but they're still pretty dangerous. Their bites give us Defocus and Sunder. They can also swoop down on us multiple times as their attack.<next>Whenever we get rid of other enemies, they get stronger, so we gotta get rid of it first!"
MawSpore,Maw Spore,"Maw Spores can bite you to steal your positive effects, but they can also devour other enemies that have low health to strengthen themselves. They can also lick you to deal Water damage and steal your energy as well. Attacking them will provoke a counterattack, like with normal Eye Spores.","Maw Spores can bite you to steal your positive effects, but they can also devour other enemies that have low health to strengthen themselves. They can also lick you to deal Water damage and steal your energy as well.<next>Attacking them will provoke a counterattack, so be careful when fighting them.",They can eat our buffs and eat their allies too to get stronger. Taking them out first will stop them from getting too strong. They can lick us to steal energy.,"They can eat our buffs but they can also eat their own allies too. They can lick us to steal our energy too, so we better get rid of them first!"
CaveSpider,Cave Spider,Cave Spiders are smaller versions of the Spore Spider. They can protect themselves or weave copies of other enemies. They can hang from their own silk to fly up.,Cave Spiders can hang from their own silk and they can also shield themselves or weave copies of other enemies.,"We've dealt with a bigger one before, this one is no problem. The cave spiders around here can shield themselves or make copies of other enemies, and they can also fly up by hanging from their silk.",Why does everything around here have to be so creepy? These spiders can shield themselves or weave up more friends for themselves.
Obscurer,Obscurer,"Obscurers are stronger versions of Shrouders. The main thing that makes Obscurers so dangerous is that nothing can hurt them as long as any of their allies has more health than them. However, Obscurers also have negative defense so they are easy to remove after their allies were weakened",The worst of the worst of the Shrouded Valley. Obscurers can hide their allies from your attacks but they can't be hit if any of their allies are healthier than them. They can also blow clouds of spores that make it harder to use skills and permanently boosts their attack.<next>Make sure you get through everything quickly so you can deal with them.,Obscurers can hide our enemies from attacks and blow dark clouds that make it harder for us to move and boosts them permanently. We can't even hit them unless everything healthier than them is gone. We have to go fast so they can't get too strong.,It's flying up high and it can hide all our enemies from us. We can't touch it unless everything with more health is gone. Maybe that's what I cn doing?
SporeSpider,Spore Spider,"A large spider whose den is in the deepest part of the Shrouded Valley. Mosquitoes are taught from a young age to never venture too close to her territory, lest they become her next meal, or become a spore zombie. She has the power to manipulate and weave fungus into various structures. She will summon different types of structures to shield herself from different attacking directions and give herself healing and buffs.",KeruDefault_SporeSpider,WilexDefault_SporeSpider,LunaDefault_SporeSpider
MoonSpider,Moon Spider,"While sunlight has a very difficult time making it to the ground in the Shrouded Valley, moonlight seems to have an easier time getting there. This version of the Spore Spider has managed to absorb some of this moonlight, taking on the power to take different forms with different defensive properties.",KeruDefault_MoonSpider,WilexDefault_MoonSpider,LunaDefault_MoonSpider
Shieldwing,Shieldwing,"Shieldwings are large flightless birds covered in a thick layer of feathers that collect ice and snow on them. They are very protective of their territory and flock.<line><line>Shieldwings will often protect their allies with ice magic. Intruders on their territory are likely going to be pecked, but Shieldwings also have an icy screech attack that freezes their enemies. Their feathers are sometimes used to make feather dusters.","Shieldwings have thick, icy feathers that give them high defense but also make them vulnerable to Fire damage. They will usually attack whoever has the most health, but they can also screech at you to Freeze everyone and deal Light damage.<next>The screech will reduce their defense because of the Light damage, so you should keep their health up.","Shieldwings are covered in thick feathers, so they have a lot of defense. Fire attacks will hurt them a lot more though. Poisoning them is also a good idea too.<next>They can screech at us to freeze us both, and they can boost all their allies defense, so we should take them down fast.","Wow, that's a really bulky birdie! It's got a lot of defense, but they're pretty weak to Fire damage. It likes going after whoever has more health, so it'll probably go after me more often."
Honeywing,Honeywing,"Similar to Honeybuds, they produce nectar to heal their allies. However, this comes from their wings, instead of coming from a flower on their heads. Honeywings can also spit at their enemies to deal water damage, but their healing is slightly weaker immediately after doing that. Honeywing honey is one of the components used to produce Royal Syrup.","Honeywings can produce honey from their wings to heal their allies. They can spit some nectar at their enemies to do weak Water damage, or they can swoop down normally to do Normal damage.<next>They are weak to Dark damage, and they are weak to becoming Dizzy or Paralyzed.","Honeywings can heal everyone, so I better take them out first. Paralyzing them will work, but that won't stop them from healing.","These little birdies make tasty honey from their wings, and they use it to heal all their allies. They can attack by swooping down at us or by spitting at us. We should probably target them first, so that they stop healing everyone."
Shimmerwing,Shimmerwing,"These birds have sparkling feathers resembling the snowy ground of the Radiant Plateau, making them often difficult to see when on the ground.<line><line>Their main attack is to screech loudly in order to dazzle their enemies. Shimmerwings can also empower their allies by singing a song. Flocks of Shimmerwings are very dangerous because they can all empower each other with their songs.","These loud birds are known for their painfully loud screeches that can make you Dizzy. The screech reduces your defense, so keeping your health up is a good idea.<next>They can also sing a song that gives Focus to all their allies, but they can't sing this song from the ground, so keeping them down may be a good strategy.","They're loud and obnoxious, and they're everywhere in the Radiant Plateau. They screech loud enough to make us Dizzy, and they can also sing a song that makes all of their allies stronger.<next>Grounding them will stop them from boosting everyone, but it won't stop their ear piercing screeches. I better shut them up as soon as I can.","Their songs are beautiful, but they also like screeching at us to make us Dizzy. Their songs also make their allies stronger, so we should probably stop that too."
LumistarVanguard,Lumistar Vanguard,"While they don't wield a sword like the other soldiers in Lumistar's army, Vanguards still play an important role as they can improve the defenses of their allies, while also dealing spread damage. Their attacks can hit Ethereal targets, and Dark attacks have no effect on them.<line><line>Some soldiers find them difficult to work with, due to their loud horn blasts and bright lantern flashes, as well as the fact that Vanguards tend to stay behind while letting the other soldiers take the brunt of attacks.","Vanguards usually hide behind the other soldiers, supporting them by boosting their allies Defense with their lanterns. They can also do a stronger Light damage spread attack with their horn blasts.<next>Dark attacks do nothing against them, but Water attacks are their weakness. They are also weak to being made Dizzy.<next>I've heard that they're not especially liked by the other branches of the Lumistar military, because their horn blasts and lantern flashes become annoying after a while.","These guys are the worst! Their horn blasts really hurt my ears, and hiding from their attacks doesn't even work either because of their lantern. Their ridiculous getup makes them immune to Dark attacks somehow.<next>Lantern flashes can also boost the defense of all their allies. At least they don't have as much health as the other soldiers, and they're weak to water.","They do a lot of Light attacks, so hiding from them doesn't work. They can also boost their allies defense by blasting their horn."
LumistarSoldier,Lumistar Solider,"These large, bulky soldiers are one of the core elements of Lumistar's army. The armor is too heavy for tiercels and sparrows to wear, so Lumistar Soliders are almost always formels and polar bears.<line><line>They usually focus on making slow, powerful sword slices, as their armor prevents them from making delicate movements. They can charge up to do a much stronger sword slash. It's important to avoid their charge attacks if possible.","These Soldiers are heavy infantry, wearing heavy armor that gives them high defense. They can attack with a normal sword swing, or with a powerful charge swing. However, they are weak to Fire and Dark damage. You can also try to use Poison and Sleep against them.","That heavy armor slows down their attacks, but they still hurt a lot. I should hide from their charge attack since it does massive damage.<next>That armor doesn't protect them from Dark and Fire attacks though, so I should try using one of those to deal with them. Poison also works on them pretty well.","That sword's almost as tall as I am... Maybe Wilex should get one like that? I think he likes the one he has though. That armor they're wearing gives them a lot of defense, but Fire damage will go through it.<next>They like to do big sword swings, and sometimes they charge up to do a really heavy attack."
LumistarStriker,Lumistar Striker,"These small, nimble fighters form the majority of Lumistar's army. Their armor is not very thick, but it is light enough not to restrict their movement or flight. Most of their training goes into fast and precise sword strikes, allowing them to slice targets many times in quick succession.<line><line>Despite being able to fly, they can only attack on the ground, so they only go airborne for short periods of time. Their main attack is a dual slash attack, but they can also charge in order to do a quadruple slash.","Strikers have armor that gives them some defense. They attack by swinging their swords multiple times, but they can also charge up to do a quadruple slice.<next>They can also fly for short periods of time, but they can't swing their swords while flying.","They have two swords, but can't hit as hard as I can. Looks like they haven't found out that more swords doesn't mean more power. Their charge attack is pretty strong though, so I should hide from it.","They're using two swords, so they can probably slash us a lot of times. They can fly, but they can't attack us while flying so they'll have to come down after a short time. Wilex should try to hide us when they charge up so we don't get hit by that."
Spikeflake,Spikeflake,Spikeflakes have a very stiff structure that breaks immediately after a strong enough hit. They are weak to Earth damage. They can also split themselves into two if left alone for too long. They can blow electric wind to apply Supercharge to themselves and they can shoot icy spikes to deal Light damage three times.,"Spikeflakes can blow electric wind to deal Air/Electric damage and Supercharge themselves, and they can shoot icy spikes at you. Their stiff bodies will make them immune to any attack that doesn't kill them outright, but they can split themselves if left for too long.","They blow electric wind at us and gives themselves Supercharge, and they can also shoot Light damage spikes at us. Weak hits do nothing against them, but one strong hit will break them completely. They'll split apart if left alone for too long, so if we can't beat them normally that is another way to deal with them.","They blow electric wind at us and gives themselves Supercharge, and they can also shoot Light damage spikes at us. If we leave them alone, they'll split into two so we can wait if we can't hurt them.<next>Hitting them won't do anything unless we hit them hard enough to beat them in one hit."
Mirrorwing,Mirrorwing,Mirrorwings can attack by swooping down twice or Illuminate themselves and one of their allies. Attacking anyone will have the Mirrorwing Illuminate the damaged ally and then attack you.,These loud birds are known for their ability to counter attacks on their allies. The counter attack also Illuminates the damaged ally as well.<next>They can also sing a song that gives Illuminate to themselves and an ally. They can also swoop down on you twice.,"They're loud and obnoxious, and annoying to deal with too. They counter all of our attacks, and they can also sing a song that Illuminates themselves and an ally.<next>Grounding them can stop their counter attacks. I better shut them up as soon as I can.","Their songs are beautiful, but they also like countering all our attacks too. Their songs also make their allies Illuminated, so we should probably stop that too."
Beaconwing,Beaconwing,Beaconwings protect their allies that were hit by you. They can do spread Light damage charge attacks that give themselves Soften,"Beaconwings have thick, icy feathers that give them high defense but also make them vulnerable to Fire damage. They do extremely strong Light charge attacks<next>They can also charge themselves to give themselves Soften. Hitting anyone will have the Beaconwing boost their defense.","Beaconwings are covered in thick feathers, so they have a lot of defense. Fire attacks will hurt them a lot more though. Poisoning them is also a good idea too.<next>They can do charged Light blasts, and they can boost the defense of whoever we hit.","Wow, that's a really bulky birdie! It's got a lot of defense, but they're pretty weak to Fire damage. It does big charged Light blasts, and they can protect whoever we hit."
Harmonywing,Harmonywing,Harmonywings sing along with their allies to heal each other. They are weak to all ailments and are very weak to Dark damage.,"Harmonywings can sing songs to heal their allies. They can spit some nectar at their enemies to do weak Water damage. Whenever anyone else sings, they will do an encore that heals all their allies weakly.<next>They are weak to Dark damage, and they are weak to all ailments.","Harmonywings can heal everyone and they can give encores for other songs, so I better take them out first. Any ailments will work on them so that's a good way to stop them. Dark damage is really good against them too.","These little birdies can sing healing songs and give healing encores too. They can attack by spitting at us. We should probably target them first, so that they stop healing everyone."
KingIlum,King Ilum,"The current king of Lumistar. He took power after his brother's death and his nephew's suspicious disappearance, and this uncertainty about his legitimacy has made many people wary about him. This situation was not helped by how radically different he is compared to his brother.<line><line>Ilum is seen by many as being stubborn and ruthless, compared to his brother's more diplomatic nature. Although, his supporters say that his brother was a weak king, who always gave up too much ground to others.","He definitely isn't thinking clearly... We'll need to knock some sense into him. Ilum is a skilled swordfighter who has many different sword attacks. After taking some damage he will start to use empowering moves and charge attacks.<next>He has a normal charge attack and a light beam charge attack. You can only hide from the normal charge attack, so you should pay attention to how he charged up.","I've always known you were nothing more than a stubborn tyrant. You're going to pay for imprisoning everyone! I can hide from most of his attacks, but his light attack is unavoidable.","We're not going anywhere until you free everyone! If you're not going to change your mind, we'll have to change it for you!"
TyrantBlade,Tyrant Blade,"Justice, loyalty and integrity are some of the most important values to Lumistar, yet this version of Ilum has none of these qualities. Traditional laws of Lumistar say that true royal legitimacy comes from the royal sword Light's Edge, whose power can only be wielded by the true ruler of Lumistar. The sword was first forged using pieces from Lumion's feathers and claws.<line><line>Throughout a ruler's reign, the sword may be stronger or weaker when wielded by them, depending on how well they embody the will of Lumion. Despite how tyrannical this version of Ilum is, it seems that the sword approves of his rule, no matter how much his subjects despise him.",KeruDefault_TyrantBlade,"This isn't too different from what the real Ilum is like. He can do the same sword moves as last time, but now he can do multiple on the same turn even from the beginning.",LunaDefault_TyrantBlade
Plateshell,Plateshell,"These turtles have metallic shells, giving them very high defense. Electrical attacks have no effect on them, since all the electricity is conducted by their shells and not by their internal organs. Plateshells can attack by slamming themselves onto their target, or they can shoot a fireball that will make their target berserk.","Plateshells have very armored shells that give them high defense, and make them immune to Electric attacks. They can attack by slamming their shells into you, or by shooting a fireball that can make you Berserk.<next>Water and Earth damage is slightly more effective against them, but you will still have to go through some of their defense.","They're big and really well armored, I can't even pierce that armor with electricity. Water attacks do a little bit more but it doesn't go through all their defenses. They can jump on us or shoot fireballs that make us Berserk.","Plateshells have big metal shells that give them a ton of defense and makes Electric attacks not work on them. I think Earth attacks can get through some of their armor though, so maybe that's what I should be doing."
Speartongue,Speartongue,"These dark scaled creatures have sharp, pointy tongues. They use their tongues to stab into enemies to poison them. Speartongues can also become Ethereal for short periods of time by changing the color of their skin, making them impossible to hit with non-Light attacks. They can also spot Ethereal beings, and they can hit them with a weak eye beam attack.<line><line>Speartongues often find themselves in more reconnaissance based roles in the Glimmerkey Guild due to their ability to become Ethereal and their good eyesight.","Speartongues can hide themselves from your attacks, and they can also hit you by staring you down even if you try to hide yourself. Their tongues can deal Dark damage and inflict Poison.<next>They are immune to Dark attacks, but Light attacks are their weakness.","They have pointy tongues that they can stab us with to poison us, and they can hide themselves sometimes too. They can still hit us even if I try to hide, so that probably isn't a good idea.<next>Light damage is probably what we need, since they can't hide from that.","Their tongues are really pointy, and they can poison us with them. They can try to hide, but they can't hide from a Light Smash! They have a Light attack of their own though, so Wilex probably shouldn't try to hide us."
Chaintail,Chaintail,"Chaintails have shiny, golden colored scales that resemble the gold coins commonly used as currency around the world. They can shock enemies with their claws to paralyze them and they can also hit enemies with their tail. Despite commonly using electrical attacks, Chaintails are not immune to electrical attacks themselves.<line><line>Chaintails are often in the public-facing roles of the Glimmerkey Guild due to their dazzling appearance.","Chaintails are covered in spikes on their back, so stomping on them will hurt you. They can use their claws to do Electric damage and Paralyze you, or they can swing their tails around to do stronger Normal damage.<next>They are immune to Fire damage, but Electric damage still works on them despite how they use Electric attacks. They are also slightly weak to Water damage.","They like doing electrical attacks, so Water damage is probably the way to go here. Fire damage does nothing to them, but Electric damage will still work.","Chaintails have a lot of shiny spikes, so jumping on them is a bad idea. They like doing Electric attacks with their claws, but they can also whip their tails at us too. They're also immune to Fire damage, but Electric damage still works on them."
Sawcrest,Sawcrest,"These strange lizards have sharp, serrated crests on their head and back. They will activate their saws in order to do more damaging attacks. Attacking them will cause them to change their state.<line><line>Blocking their attacks while their saws are engaged is quite difficult, as they move fast and hit all their targets multiple times in quick succession, so it is usually advised to try to prevent their saws from being active.","Sawcrests are aggressive lizards with many sawblades on their body. If their saws are active, their attacks will be a lot more dangerous, so you should try to keep their saws off if you can.<next>Attacking them will toggle their saws from on to off, or from off to on. Stomping on them will only hurt if their saws are active.","They're covered in saws, but they only get dangerous when their saws are spinning. I should try to stop their saws from spinning by attacking them when their saws are on.","All those saws look pretty scary, but Sawcrests aren't that strong if those aren't spinning. I should try hitting them when their saws are spinning to stop them."
Coiler,Coiler,"Coilers are snails with conductive metal on their shells that allows them to store immense amounts of electrical energy for powerful shockwaves. Most of the energy they store is on the outside of their shell, so they will always hide in their shell before doing these strong attacks to protect themselves from their own electricity. Approaching a charged Coiler is a dangerous since their electrical field extends far out from their body.","Coilers can charge themselves to do strong electrical attacks. When they're charged, you shouldn't get close to them or you will get hurt, even if you try to attack with your weapons.<next>Light and Water attacks are more effective against them, so you should use those.","I should stay away from them when they're charged up, since they get covered in sparks. Water is probably good against them, since they like using Electric attacks.","When they're hiding in their shells, we should stay away, since they get covered in sparks that'll hurt us if we try to use our weapons on them. I think Water works well on them though."
Drillbeak,Drillbeak,"Drillbeaks are strange creatures with conical beaks that they use to attack targets. While their propeller and beak are made of metal, the rest of their skin is not, giving them weaker defense than other creatures in the Aether Trench. To compensate for this, Drillbeaks are very aggressive and vicious with their attacks.","Drillbeaks have no defense, but they're very vicious to compensate for that. Their attacks hit multiple times, dealing a lot of damage if you aren't careful.","I have no idea what Luna sees in these things... All I see is another flying pest. They like to jam their beaks in us to hit multiple times. They can do a lot of damage but they don't have any defense, so we can get rid of them easily.","These guys look pretty cute, but they're also really dangerous. They like to poke their beak at us multiple times to attack. I feel kind of bad attacking it though. Maybe Wilex can handle this one?"
Quickworm,Quickworm,"Quickworms are known for their quick bites. On their real turn, they can pass their own turn to others or swoop through all their enemies.","Quickworms act after each of your actions. On their real turn, they can swoop through both of you or pass their turns off to one of the other enemies.","They move pretty fast, so we better target them first. They can give their allies bonus turns or they can swoop through us.",They move so fast! I should get Wilex to handle them first since they're flying.
AetherBoss,Cutle,"Cutle's ultimate goal with the Soul Cores was to help him survive within the Molten Titan and obtain the Glimmerkey from within. He and his brother were the only ones who actually believed the Glimmerkey was within the Molten Titan, with everyone else they knew believing that they're chasing a myth, or that their quest for the Glimmerkey would be the death of them.<line><line>His brother's death within the Molten Titan has done nothing but embolden him.

PuffJelly,Puff Jelly,"A small, fluffy, floating jellyfish common in the Crystal Hills. Their light coloration camoflages them against the clouds in the sky. Puff Jellies will try to hit their targets from above to avoid being spotted before they attack.","Puff Jellies are small jellyfish found around the Crystal Hills. They attack by falling down on you. You can hit them down with your attacks, but they can fly back up on their turn after being knocked down.",They fly back up pretty soon after I hit them down. Looks like I'll have to take them down to let Luna hit them too.,"They keep flying back up when we get them down, so it sounds like it's Wilex's job to take them out."
Fluffling,Fluffling,A fluffy variant of normal Leaflings. Flufflings ram into enemies instead of biting them.,"Flufflings are similar to Leaflings, but they will ram into anything they come across because they are very territorial. The timing of their attack is slightly unpredictable, so you need to pay attention to them closely to block their attacks.","Flufflings attack by jumping into us. It still hurts us, even though they're covered in fluff. I should pay attention to their attacks, since the timing is hard to predict.","They're so cute and fluffy! But they aren't very cute when they're ramming into us. It's hard to predict how fast they'll jump into us, so I have to watch them carefully."
Floppole,Floppole,"Floppoles are distant relatives of Cactupoles in the desert. Floppoles can't fly, but instead they are more adept at moving by flopping around or flopping onto their enemies. They can flop with Air/Electric element also.","These tadpoles have hard skin and thorns that give them high defense and makes them look like cacti. They can flop onto you to attack, and one of their attacks does Air/Electric damage.<next>Their thorns make them dangerous to jump on, so be careful when dealing with them.","A flopping cactus... Shouldn't be too hard to deal with. They have Air/Electric attacks, so maybe Luna can handle them.<next>Jumping on them is gonna hurt but I might not have much of a choice.",It's a flopping cactus covered in spikes. I should hit them with my hammer since jumping on them will hurt us.
HydroJelly,Hydro Jelly,"A large jellyfish with multiple forms, changing between them based on the types of attacks used against them. The Ice form is grounded and uses defensive moves, but has weaker attacks. The Water form is grounded and has a spread attack. The Cloud form is airborne and strong attacks, as well as a power boosting move and a healing move. More defensive forms have more defense.","Cloud Jellies are complicated creatures that have three different forms. The icy form has the weakest attacks but they can fortify themselves. The water form has two different watery attacks with one being a spread attack.<next>The cloud form can fly and fire off strong lightning bolts, as well as heal and charge themselves. Light, Water and Electric attacks will change them into more defensive forms, while other damage types do the opposite. ","Looks like it has three different forms it can go between. Light, Water and Electric attacks make them go into more defensive forms while other damage types do the opposite. It's weak to Fire in any form though, so that's probably what I should do here.","It looks like Light, Water and Air damage makes them go into weaker forms, while other types of damage makes them become stronger. Fire damage is their weakness in any form, but that makes them stronger."
CrystalCrab,Crystal Crab,"A crystalline creature with sharp claws. Their crystal body is mostly transparent, but some light will refract on the inside. Light attacks deal massive damage to them due to this internal refraction. They can also turn other enemies into crabs if they are at low hp.","Crystal Crabs have high defense, but are weak to Light damage. They are also immune to Electric damage.<next>They can do a triple hit attack that does Normal damage, or they can do a strong Dark attack that hits both of you while inflicting Sleep.<next>They can also turn other enemies into Crystal Crabs, so try to get rid of the crabs first so that can't happen.","These crabs are dark on the inside, so Light damage probably works well against them. I can't get through their defense with Electric attacks, so Luna can probably take care of them.<next>Their claws can hit us multiple times, but they can also blast us with a Dark attack that puts us to sleep.<next>They can also turn lower health enemies into crabs, so I shouldn't leave any of them alive.","The insides of that crab look dark, so Light damage probably hurts them a lot. They can hit us multiple times with their claws or they can put us to sleep with a big Dark attack.<next>I should also watch out for them turning other things into crabs."
CrystalSlug,Crystal Slug,A slug with sparkling skin. They give off a weak light from the inside of their bodies and their eyes. They can shoot light beams from their eyes to attack. Dark attacks are very strong against them due to their light-based nature.,"Crystal Slugs have middling defense, but they are weak to Dark damage. They are also immune to Electric damage. They can attack by slapping you or by staring you down to do strong Light damage and Freezing you.<next>You should try your best not to get frozen by their attacks, by taking them out before they can stare you down.","They're glowing on the inside, so Dark damage probably hurts them a lot more. Electric attacks won't work on them though. I should watch out for their freezing stares.","They're bright on the inside, so Dark attacks probably hurt them a lot. They can slap us, or freeze us by staring at us."
CrystalClam,Crystal Clam,"A clam that has trouble attacking on its own, but it can heal its allies or remove positive effects from its enemies. If left alone for too long, they will use a strong explosion attack. They will also explode if they have no allies left.","Crystal Clams don't have any normal defense, but their reinforced bodies will make them immune to any attack that doesn't kill them outright. They cannot attack directly normally, but they can remove your buffs or heal their allies.<next>Don't leave them for last, as they will explode if they have no other allies. They will also explode after enough time has passed.","These guys can't attack normally, but they can heal or remove our buffs. Weak hits do nothing against them, but one strong hit will break them completely. They'll explode if left alone for too long, or if their allies are gone.<next>I should take them out first so they can't keep healing everyone.","They won't attack us most of the time, but they will keep healing all their allies and clearing all our buffs, so we should take care of them pretty quickly. If we leave them alone, they'll blow up on us too.<next>Hitting them won't do anything unless we hit them hard enough to beat them in one hit."
AuroraWing,Aurorawing,"These strange creatures have iridescent wings that they use to spread crystal dust to attack enemies and boost their allies. They are quite fragile, making them weak to all statuses.<line><line>Aurora Wings are made up of many different types of gemstones, which gives them a wide array of elemental attacks and support moves.","Aurora Wings are flying birds with crystalline wings. They can blow gemstone dust at you to boost all their allies while also doing damage to you. You should focus on them first, as they can heal their allies or boost their attack and defense.<next>Light damage will be absorbed by them, and Dark attacks are their weakness. They are also weak to all ailments.","Their wings look kinda flimsy, I think ailments could work well against them. They spread dust everywhere to hurt us and boost all their allies, so I better take them out fast or make sure they can't do anything.<next>Dark attacks are their weakness, so I should get ready to do one once I get them down.","They're really pretty, but also really dangerous. The wind they blow will boost all their allies and also hurt us too. Light attacks will heal them, so I shouldn't use any of those. I think they're weak to Dark attacks though.<next>Ailments are also good against them too, so that's another way to deal with them."
FinalBoss,Cyclus,"The Top Adventurer, consumed by ambition and wielding the combined powers of the Soul Crown, Glimmerkey and Mother Core. He believes the world is filled with lazy weaklings, who are unworthy of life.<line><line>In his eyes, the world needs someone like him to establish a new order, a world where weakness and imperfection are stamped out under his command. He has skill with bladed weapons of all kinds, making him a versatile and unpredictable fighter.",KeruDefault_FinalBoss,WilexDefault_FinalBoss,LunaDefault_FinalBoss
FinalSuperboss,King of Ideals,"Cyclus's true origins were within the Realm of Possibility. Lady Meryl entered the Realm in search of her sister, and found an orphaned egg.<line><line>She raised the egg as her own son, who she named Cyclus. Being from the Realm of Possibility filled his mind with the knowledge and ideals of those in the Realm, allowing him to become a weapons master at a young age.<line><line>However, this is also the reason behind his beliefs, as his frustration with the imperfect world fueled his ambitions to reshape it no matter the cost.",KeruDefault_FinalSuperboss,WilexDefault_FinalSuperboss,LunaDefault_FinalSuperboss
DarkBurrower,DarkBurrower,"Dark Burrowers are carnivorous plants that are stronger versions of Burrow Traps. They often try to take their prey by surprise, by emerging right next to them. Pollen from their bites makes their prey sleepy, making it harder for them to escape or fight back.<line><line>If they or any of their allies are attacked, they will retaliate with an attack stronger and faster than normal. Killing them won't stop them from countering, as they will get one last hit before dying.","Dark Burrowers attack by biting you and covering you in sleepy pollen. The pollen makes you Sleep for a short time, so you probably want to take care of them first if you aren't good at blocking.<next>However, they will retaliate whenever you hit them or any of their allies, so you should try to use your strongest attacks on them to get rid of them more quickly. They will always be able to make at least one counter attack though, no matter how hard you hit them.","They really want to put us to sleep with their pollen and they also counter when they get hit or any of their allies get hit, so I should hit them as hard as I can. But even if I do that, they'll still get one more counter in before they die.","Their pollen makes us sleepy, and they will also fight back when we hit them or any of their friends. Let's give them everything we got!"
Shadew,Shadew,"Shadews are dark and sticky plants that are stronger versions of Sundews. They will lob these large droplets at anyone who gets near them to splash all of them.<line><line>Attacking them will also cause them to retaliate, so care must be taken when trying to remove them. Killing them won't stop them from fighting back, as they will get one last attack in.","Shadews attack by fling large sticky droplets towards you. Those droplets inflict Poison, so you should try your best to avoid them.<next>Attacking them will make them retaliate, so you should try to use your strongest attacks on them to get rid of them more quickly. They will always be able to make at least one counter attack though, no matter how hard you hit them.","I better avoid those poison droplets they splash on us. They strike back when they get hurt, so I should hit them as hard as I can. But even if I kill them in one hit, they still get one last counter attack.","I really don't want that poison in my fur, so I should try avoiding their attacks. They fight back when they get hit though, so I should hit them as hard as possible. They can splash us both with their attacks too."
VileBloom,Vilebloom,"Vile Blooms are strange purple slimy creatures that are not ctually plants. They will attack by throwing dual balls of water at their target or by blowing dusty wind. Their tentacles are dark and toxic, making direct contact with them dangerous. They are weak to all ailments. They can heal themselves after any of their allies dies.","They are not actually flowers, but they still draw energy from the ground. You should prioritize them first, since they can heal themselves if any of their other allies dies.<next>Their tentacles are also covered in dark slime so you shouldn't stomp on them. They are weak to all ailments. You should not use Water or Earth attacks as they can absorb Water and are immune to Earth damage.","Weird looking flowers... Those tentacles are covered in dark slime that hurts if we stomp on them. They can lob double slime balls at us or blow dusty wind at us.<next>We better get rid of them fast so they heal themselves if we deal with the other enemies. They're weak to all ailments, so maybe that's the way to deal with them.",I can't tell if these are flowers or not... Getting a closer look is probably a bad idea since I'll get slimed by their tentacles. They can dust us or throw slime balls at us. They also heal themselves if their friends die.<next>We should get rid of them so they can't do that.
Thornweed,Thornweed,"Despite their large size, they are very fragile, they can only survive a few hits no matter how strong they are. They can attack by sundering everyone or by spinning against the front enemy.","Thornweeds are covered in thorns, like what the name suggests. You should avoid being hit by their spikes, since they cn sunder you. No matter how hard they are hit, they barely take any damage, but they can only withstand a few of these hits.","All those spikes are make it hard to get a good hit on them, but only a few hits will take them down. I won't get poked by the spikes if I Electro Stomp them, so that's probably the way to beat these things.",So sharp and pointy... I should get rid of them fast so I don't get poked. It only takes a few hits to break them so it shouldn't be too hard to get rid of them.
Plaguebud,Plaguebud,"These strange creatures look similar to Leaflings and Flowerlings, but they are much stronger. They can shoot seeds from the flowers on their head and tail to inflict powerful debuffs. The tail flower is more dangerous, as the seeds will do more damage and poison their targets.","Plaguebuds can bite you, but they will usually attack by launching seeds from the flower on their head or the flower on their tail.<next>The tail seed is more dangerous, as it will poison you as well as give every other enemy a chance to lower your defense.<next>The head seed is weaker, but it will give the other enemies a chance to heal themselves and lower your attack when they hit you. They can absorb Water damage, but they are slight weak to Fire and Light damage.","Watering them will heal them, so I shouldn't do any water attacks. They have a lot of health and they can shoot seeds at us to let their allies heal by attacking us. Fire damage can probably get rid of them pretty quickly though.","They're big and bulky, but they don't have a lot of defense. They like to shoot seeds at us that let their allies heal by attacking us. I should watch out for their tail sprout, since it does a lot more damage and Poisons us.<next>I think Fire and Light damage can get rid of them pretty quickly."
Starfish,Starfish,"Starfish appear quite fragile, but their strange structure makes them surprisingly resilient. No matter how hard they are hit, they barely take any damage, but they can only withstand a few of these hits. They bear a resemblance to Strange Tendrils, which suggests that Starfishes could be a juvenile form of Strange Tendrils.<line><line>Starfishes can use many different powerful spread damage attacks that also inflict debuffs. They will also split off if hit without killing them.","They look fragile, but Starfish are tougher than they look. No matter how hard you hit them, they barely take any damage, but you can still beat them with only a few hits.<next>Make sure you remove them quickly, since they have strong spread attacks that also inflict debuffs.<next>They will also split into two if you hit them, so try to hit them with multi hit attacks.","They barely have any health, but it looks like I still have to hit it a few times to beat it. Their attacks are really dangerous too, so I should hit them as many times as I can<next>They can split into two if I don't kill them, so tht's more reason I should hit them a lot.","I don't understand them at all... No matter how hard I hit them, they barely flinch, but they seem pretty fragile though. I think Wilex can deal with them better than I can.<next>If I hit them they'll split into two, so he can probably beat them with a bunch of hits at once."
CursedEye,Cursed Eye,"Cursed Eyes have sensitive eyesight, allowing them to see Ethereal targets, but they are vulnerable to bright lights. They will remain airborne now matter how hard they are hit, and they are immune to all negative effects. Their unfocused gaze will deal weaker spread Light damage, while their focused gaze will deal stronger Dark damage. They tend to focus their gaze on those with less health. If they are hit, they will stare down their attacker in retaliation.","These eyeballs usually like to focus their attention on whoever has less health, but they can also use a spread Light attack as well. No matter what you do, you can't bring them down or even inflict negative effects on them.<next>Attacking them provokes a counterattack, so you need to prepared for that.","It's staring me down... I don't like it. They like to focus their attention on whoever seems the most vulnerable. Hiding from it doesn't work, and there's no way to get them down.<next>I'll probably have to deal with them alone, even if it means provoking them to counter me.","There's no way to bring it down, so it would take a lot of Energy for me to get rid of it. Maybe I should focus on helping Wilex. He should be careful though, since hitting them makes them hit back."
StrangeTendril,Strange Tendril,"Strange Tendrils can extend very deep underground or underwater, so only a small part of their length is actually visible most of the time, except when they are attacking or coiling up. Their skin gives them high defense and immunity to electricity. However, statuses are very effective against them. Attacking one tendril appears to make nearby tendrils flinch as well, which implies that they are connected, but nobody has been able to determine for sure whether or not they are all actually connected to each other.","Strange Tendrils are very durable, giving them high defense including a lot of defense against Electricity. However, they are weak to all ailments, so you should try to use poison against them if you can.<next>They can slam into you as their attack, or they can coil up to boost the defense of themselves and one of their allies.","What are these things made of? They have a lot of defense and electrical attacks can't even pierce that. They're really weak to poison though, so maybe that's how I should beat them.<next>Getting rid of them fast is pretty important, since they'll boost the defense of their allies.","I've always been creeped out by these things... They can wriggle around to boost one of their allies defense or they can slam into us as their attack. They have really high defense too, and Electric attacks can't pierce it.<next>I think ailments will work on them though. Maybe Wilex can take them down with poison?"
DrainBud,Drain Bud,"Drain Buds are strange flower-like creatures known for their ability to heal from most attacks instead of taking damage. However, they can still be hurt by Light, Fire and Electric attacks. Statuses are also very effective against them. Their main attack is to drain health from opponents by enveloping them, damaging them in a three hit pattern.","Drain Buds can heal from most attacks, but they are weak to Light, Fire and Electric damage. They are also especially weak to statuses as well. Like their name suggests, they will try to drain health from you as their attack.<next>You should try to focus on them first, since otherwise they may be able to heal back all the damage you do to them.","Hitting them normally will make them heal, so I should try using Fire or Electric attacks on them. I better take them out first, so they don't suck the life out of us. It'll also be annoying to try to hit everyone at the same time with them around.","They heal if we hit them normally, so we should try to be careful around them. I think Fire and Light damage can still hurt them normally though, and they are weak to all ailments. They can drain the life out of us, so we should get rid of them first."
