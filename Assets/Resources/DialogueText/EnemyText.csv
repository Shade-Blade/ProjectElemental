DebugEntity,Debug Entity,"This text should not appear as the Debug Entity is not supposed to appear in any battles or appear in the Bestiary. Although, you can see this text by hacking or datamining the game. If you're a hacker or dataminer, then you should probably stop.",I don't think this text is supposed to appear anywhere. We should report this as a bug.,Something isn't right here… This text isn't supposed to show up anywhere. Sounds like someone broke the game.,"Woah, I don't have any idea what that thing is. Maybe we should report this as a bug."
Leafling,Leafling,"A small, common mammal native to the Verdant Forests, although it is also found in the Solar Grove.<line><line>Despite being small, they have a ravenous appetite. Travellers should steer clear of them so the Leaflings don't mistake them for a meal.","Leaflings are pretty weak, so you shouldn't have much trouble with them. They like to chew on everything they come across, which unfortunately includes you two.","Ugh, these guys are annoying! All they do is chew on everything. Good thing they're easy to get rid of.","Aww, it's so cute! Maybe we can keep one? I don't think Wilex would like that though."
Flowerling,Flowerling,"These relatives of Leaflings are known for their ability to fly. The flowers on their head they use to fly are quite delicate, so attacking them will render the Flowerling unable to fly for the rest of battle.<line><line>Like regular Leaflings, they are constantly searching for an easy meal, so they will attack anything that looks edible.","Flowerlings can fly high enough that you can't attack them with your normal weapon moves, but if you can manage to hit them, they'll fall down and won't be able to fly back up for the rest of battle.",Flying guys are no problem for me. I'll just have to stomp on it to make it come down.,It's flying a bit too high for me… Maybe Wilex can handle it?
Shrublet,Shrublet,"Despite living in similar environments to regular Leaflings, this variant is covered in rough thorns and has a stronger bite. The thorns make it dangerous to come into contact with them.","Shrublets are covered in thorns, so you really shouldn't stomp on them. Stomping on them will still hurt them, but you'll get hurt too. Make sure you hit them from a distance with your weapons.","These guys have a pretty strong bite, so I should probably get rid of them first. Stomping on them is gonna hurt, but I might not have a choice.",Those thorns look pretty painful… I should try hitting them from a distance. Good thing I have a hammer!
Rootling,Rootling,"The guardian of the Soul Crown in the Solar Grove. While it is much weaker than the previous guardian, it is still quite large and powerful. Similar to regular Leaflings, the Rootling has a large appetite, made even larger by its massive size.<line><line>The Rootling is good at digging, and it will often dig underground to evade attackers as well as to prepare a stronger attack.","This is the guardian of the Solar Grove. When it hides underground, it's preparing to do a stronger attack, so that is your best time to heal or prepare yourself.","It looks pretty big, but it seems weaker than it looks. I can't hit it when it goes underground, so that's probably a good time to Focus.","Sorry we have to do this, but we really have to get through! When it goes underground, it looks like it's preparing for something big, so I should make sure we're ready for that."
Sunflower,Sunflower,"Sunflowers are stronger versions of Flowerlings, who have flaming flowers. Their flower is very good at absorbing sunlight, and that energy is used to fuel the flame. The flame protects them from direct attacks as direct attackers will be burned by it.<line><line>Sunflowers do not need to eat much food as much of their energy comes from absorbing solar energy, but they are still quite aggressive. Unlike with Flowerlings, they can quickly recover from being grounded.","This is a flaming version of normal Flowerlings. You'll get burned if you try to jump on them, so you'll need to find another way to deal with them.<next>They're better at flying than normal Flowerlings, so hitting them down will only ground them up until their next turn.","They’re both flying and burning… That's a dangerous combination. If I stomp on them, they will come down, but I'll get burned if I do that.<next>Maybe I should try getting them down a different way…","I already have a hard time with flying enemies, but now this guy is burning too, so Wilex can't stomp on them without getting hurt. Maybe there's something I can do to get them down…"
Sunnybud,Sunnybud,"A stronger variation of Honeybuds. They are more adept at absorbing sunlight, which gives them stronger attacks and better healing.<line><line>Unlike Honeybuds, Sunnybuds can heal their allies and still stay in the air, allowing them to heal their allies for multiple turns in a row. Grounding them also won't stop them from healing on their turn.","This is a Sunnybud, a stronger version of the Honeybud. They have stronger attacks and stronger healing. Unlike Honeybuds, hitting them down to the ground won't stop them from healing on their turn.","Looks like they can heal every turn, unlike Honeybuds. I can't even stop them from healing since they can get up and heal on the same turn.<next>I better get rid of them first so they stop healing.","They really like sharing their honey with everyone. Why don't they share it with us? They can still heal even if they get hit down, so we should focus on them first."
MiracleBloom,Miracle Bloom,"The strongest and rarest variation of Honeybuds. They have extremely powerful healing and powerful attacks.<line><line>Like Sunnybuds, Miracle Blooms can heal their allies and still stay in the air, allowing them to heal their allies for multiple turns in a row. Grounding them also won't stop them from healing on their turn.","Miracle Blooms are the strongest form of Honeybuds. Their attacks are very strong, and they can heal their allies for a lot of HP.","Their honey is really good at healing. Maybe we should try taking some for ourselves. But first, we'll have to get rid of them. Let's focus on them first so they can't heal anymore.",I bet their honey tastes really great. We'll have to focus on them first to get some though.
SunSapling,Sun Sapling,"The older form of the Rootling. At this stage of its life, the Sun Sapling rarely leaves the hole it buried itself in, although it can still leave it in emergencies.<line><line>The Sun Sapling gets most of its energy through absorbing sunlight through its leaves. This energy allows them to regenerate rapidly, and it can also share its energy with others to boost their power.<line><line>Other sunlight powered creatures are drawn to the Sun Sapling due to this energy sharing.","This is what the Rootling will grow up to be. All those leaves make it regenerate quickly and allows it to boost itself and its allies. It will keep calling allies as long as it's still alive.<next>If you're having trouble keeping up with doing more damage than it regenerates, then perhaps you should try charging up to do all the damage you need to do as fast as possible.","It regenerates pretty fast and it keeps calling allies for help…Great. I should probably just focus on doing damage faster than it regenerates, or else we won't be getting anywhere.<next>But one of the things it summons can heal it, so I might have to get rid of them while also dealing with the Sapling.","Wow, it's so big! It looks like it can regenerate pretty fast and summon some friends every so often. Everything it summons is flying, so Wilex should handle them.<next>Then I should focus on making sure we do damage faster than it can heal itself, but I might need Wilex's help for that too."
Rockling,Rockling,"This is a rocky variant of the Leafling. Instead of being covered in leaves, this variant is covered with a rocky shell that gives them higher defense. Outside of that, they are quite similar to regular Leaflings, as they still tend to bite anything that comes near them.","Rocklings are a version of Leaflings but with a rocky shell instead of leaves covering them. The rock armor gives them some defense, but other than that they are the same as Leaflings.","That rocky shell gives them a bit of protection, so stomping on them probably won't do much. For some reason slashing them still works though. Maybe I can try Focusing if that still isn't enough.","It's covered in rocks, so stomping on it won't do much. This looks like a job for my Hammer. Maybe I'll have to Power Smash if my hammer isn't doing enough."
Honeybud,Honeybud,"A variation of Flowerlings native to the Verdant Forest. The flower on its head produces honey, which it can use to heal its allies.<line><line>This process renders them unable to fly for a short time while they produce more honey, and they cannot heal from the ground. However, they are better at flying than Flowerlings, being able to get back up quickly if they are grounded. The honey can also be extracted to use as a food source.","Honeybuds can fly and heal their allies using the flower on their head. Like with Flowerlings, you can hit them to make them fall down, but they can fly back up on their turn.<next>When they're in the air, they can heal their allies with honey, but they fall down when they do that.","A flying healer, huh? They can't heal while on the ground so I should keep them grounded by stomping on them.","The honey these guys make seems like it would be pretty tasty, but they use it to heal their allies, so we should probably stop them from doing that.<next>There's not a lot I can do while they're flying, but they fall down every time they heal."
BurrowTrap,Burrow Trap,"Burrow Traps are carnivorous plants that can burrow down and come up in different places. They often try to take their prey by surprise, by emerging right next to them. Their attacks often cover their prey with pollen that makes it harder for their prey to escape.<line><line>If they are attacked, they will quickly strike back with an attack that is stronger and faster than their normal one. They will always be able to counter even if they are reduced to 0 hp.","Burrow Traps attack by biting you and covering you in pollen. The pollen makes you Dizzy for a short time, so you probably want to take care of them first if you aren't good at blocking.<next>However, they will retaliate whenever you hit them, so you should try to use your strongest attacks on them to get rid of them more quickly. They will always be able to make at least one counter attack though, no matter how hard you hit them.","Ugh, their pollen is really annoying. They aim straight for the eyes to make it hard for us to see. They also retaliate when they get hit, so I should use my strongest attacks against them. But even if I do that, they'll still get at least one counter in before they die.","It's gonna take forever to get their pollen out of my fur. That pollen makes it hard for us to see, and they will also fight back when we hit them. We better beat them with our strongest attacks!"
Sundew,Sundew,"Sundews are strange plants that produce sticky poison droplets on the ends of their tentacles. They will throw this poison towards any movement they sense, in an attempt to hit prey or any would-be predators.<line><line>As a defense mechanism, attacking them will cause them to retaliate against whoever attacked it.  They will always be able to counter even if they are reduced to 0 hp.","Sundews attack by fling sticky droplets towards you. Those droplets inflict Poison, so you should try your best to avoid them.<next>Attacking them will make them retaliate, so you should try to use your strongest attacks on them to get rid of them more quickly. They will always be able to make at least one counter attack though, no matter how hard you hit them.","These guys like flinging poison everywhere, so I better avoid those droplets. They strike back when they get hurt, so I should try using my strongest attacks on them. But even if I kill them in one hit, they will still get a counter attack.","I really don't want that poison in my fur, so I should try avoiding their attacks. They fight back when they get hit though, so I should hit them as hard as possible."
VinePlatform,Vine Platform,A stiff bundle of vines sturdy enough to stand on. They can't do much else than serve as a platform though.,"It's a platform made from magical vines. It can't do much of anything on its own, but you should still bring it down since the Vineborn is stronger while standing on it.","It's just a platform, so it can't really do much. I'll have to get rid of hit to make the Vineborn fall down though.","The platform can't do much on its own, but breaking it will make the Vineborn fall down. I can't reach the Vineborn when he's high up so I'll have to break the platform."
Vineborn,Vineborn,"A strange, leafy creature that once held the Earth Core. The power of the Earth Core enhanced his plant manipulation abilities. Nobody truly knows what's behind its leaf mask, or whether there is anything under it at all.<line><line>In any case, it possesses the power to manipulate the plants and wildlife of the Verdant Forests. It can use plant based attacks as well as summon allies to assist it.","This is the Vineborn, a strange creature inhabiting the Verdant Forest that has plant manipulation powers. When he loses enough HP he will summon some plant allies and a platform to stand on. His attacks are much stronger when he's on the platform, so you should take down the platform as soon as possible.","This little guy is more dangerous than he looks! He's weak on his own but strong alongside the plants he summons. The enemies he summons have counter attacks, so we need to hit them hard so they don't get too many opportunities to attack. When he's up high his attacks are way stronger, so we better take him down fast.","I feel kinda bad hurting him, but we don't really have a choice. He will summon some allies and a platform to stand on pretty early on, so we'll have to take them all out alongside him. I can't do much to him when he's high up so I should focus on taking down the platform when he summons it."
GiantVine,Giant Vine,"A massive vine summoned by the Harvestborn. The powerful earth magic coursing through it gives it massive strength, allowing it to pick up and restrain those that would harm the Harvestborn.",This large vine can slam into you but it can also grab you after a short time. The vine seems to have a short delay before trying to grab someone.,"It feels like it's looking at me funny, even though it doesn't even have eyes. I should get cut it down before it tries something. If this thing grabs me, Luna better get me out…","That's one big vine! It looks like it's strong enough to pick us up, so we should get rid of it before it can do that. Hopefully Wilex will save me if I get grabbed."
VineThrone,Vine Throne,"A massive vine throne summoned by the Harvestborn. The powerful earth magic coursing through it makes it extremely sturdy, protecting the one on the throne from attackers.","The Vine Throne protects the Harvestborn from all attacks. You will need to destroy it to get to the Harvestborn. However, you shouldn't ignore the Giant Vines since they can grab you and take you out of the fight.",Nothing can get to the Harvestborn while this Throne is around. I'll have to cut it down fast. But I should make sure the Giant Vines don't grab me before I can destroy the Vine Throne.,"The Throne keeps the Harvestborn safe from all attacks, so we need to get rid of it to get to the Harvestborn. But those Giant Vines are also pretty dangerous, so I'll have to get rid of them too."
Harvestborn,Harvestborn,"A larger and stronger version of the Vineborn. Its plant manipulation power has become much stronger, allowing it to summon massive vines in order to attack and trap anyone who would attack it.","This is a form of the Vineborn empowered by the magic of the seasons. It looks like he can summon much stronger vines to defend himself, being able to summon Giant Vines and a Vine Throne. Like his original form, he is much stronger while on the Vine Throne so you should destroy the throne as fast as you can. However, the Giant Vines can grab you and take you out of the fight, so you will need to destroy them quickly as well.",WilexDefault_Harvestborn,LunaDefault_Harvestborn
Bandit,Bandit,"These frogs have large ears, allowing them to notice potential targets from further away.","The desert is full of these bandit frogs. They target anyone travelling in the desert but their favorite targets are anyone not from the Desert, which unfortunately includes you two. Make sure you pay attention to their attacks, since they may try to fake you out.",WilexDefault_Bandit,LunaDefault_Bandit
Renegade,Renegade,"Spiky frogs usually become outcasts due to their threatening appearance. They have pointy spines all over their back, making them dangerous to come into contact with. They also have sharp claws that they use to attack, and they can sometimes use a two hit attack.<line><line>They tend not to wear much clothing, since most clothing would be torn up by the spines on their back.","Renegades have higher health and defense than normal frogs thanks to their spiky backs. Those spikes make them dangerous to stomp on, so you should hit them from a distance. They can attack by slashing with their claws, sometimes hitting twice instead of once.","All those spikes give them some defense, but I can just slash through it. They can slash twice with one of their attacks, but I can do that too. This guy has nothing on us.",LunaDefault_Renegade
Sentry,Sentry,"Sentries are frogs with the ability to inflate themselves and fly. They tend to attack by slinging rocks, and they can also counter with a paralyzing rock. Their main tactic is to target the enemy with the lowest HP, in order to give their allies less enemies to deal with.","These frogs can blow themselves up like balloons to fly in the air, and they become spiky while airborne. They attack by tossing rocks at you with slings, but they will hit whoever has the lowest health. They can also counter attacks made against them with a paralyzing rock, so you should hit them with strong attacks.","They always try to hit whoever has the lowest health, unless someone hits them to provoke a counter attack. Taking them down is pretty hard since they're spiky when they're blown up, and electric attacks don't even work on them. I'll also have to deal with their paralyzing counter attack if I manage to take them down.","They look kinda funny when they're all blown up, but they get really spiky when they do that. Maybe there's a way I can hit them without getting hurt myself? Hitting them will make them hit back with a paralyzing rock, so I better be careful of that."
Cactupole,Cactupole,"These strange creatures inflate themselves in order to disguise themselves as cacti. In this state, their skin is electrified, making them dangerous to come into contact with.<line><line>However, they have a lot of difficulty moving while inflated, which means that they have to deflate themselves to attack.<line><line>Their main predators are Sandswimmers, who can sense the electric fields they give off.","These tadpoles have hard skin and thorns that give them high defense and makes them look like cacti. They can inflate themselves to fly, and their attacks are more dangerous when they're in the air since they can paralyze you. Their thorns make them dangerous to jump on, so be careful when dealing with them.","A flying cactus… Seems annoying to deal with. When their airborne they can shoot out paralyzing thorns. They're a lot weaker on the ground, so I should get them down if I can.","I thought it was a normal cactus for a moment… They can shoot out their thorns to paralyze us, so we should make sure we block their attacks. When they're flying I can't do too much to them, so Wilex should take them down when they're flying."
Sandswimmer,Sandswimmer,"Sandswimmers are strange mammals that can swim through the sand like water. Their large bills allow them to sense electrical fields, which helps lead them towards potential food sources. Their backs are electrified, making it dangerous to come into direct contact with them.","Sandswimmers are bulky beasts with high health but low attack. However, their bites can paralyze you, and they have shocking skin that gives them some defense and hurts if you stomp on them. ","These big guys have pretty weak attacks, but they can paralyze us with their bites. They have shocking skin, which gives them a little bit of defense. Looks like I should use my sword for this one.",LunaDefault_Sandswimmer

StormCannon,Storm Cannon,"An ancient weapon used to bring the Air Dragon, Electrion out of the sky. It shoots out the electrical energy stored within to attack, and it can draw some energy from the environment. However, the energy used to bring down Electrion came from the dragon himself, and so after his death there is now no way for the cannon to reach its maximum potential.",KeruDefault_StormCannon,WilexDefault_StormCannon,LunaDefault_StormCannon

TrainingDummy,Dummy,"An ordinary training dummy. This dummy has been around from the very beginning of the Tournament , and yet it appears almost completely undamaged.","It's a normal training dummy. I don't think you need to worry about breaking it, since the other Tournament fighters probably used it before.","Just a normal training dummy… It can survive anything we throw at it though. We need any training though, so we don't need this thing.","Did they have to give it a cute face like that? I feel kinda bad attacking it… Well it doesn't seem to mind, so I think it should be fine."
TrainingDummyBoss,Dummy?,"It seems that the dummy was inhabited by a magical spirit deep within it. The immense power of the spirit kept the dummy from being damaged, but the spirit would lay dormant until someone peered deep inside the dummy to awaken it.<line><line>The existence of this spirit raises an important question: Are there others like it?","What!? How did I not see this power before? Okay, it looks like whatever possessed the dummy can't move around, so if you run away, it can't stop you. You need to get out of there… It's way too strong to defeat.","I knew there was something wrong with the face of this thing… It has more HP than anything else we've fought, so this is going to take a while. If we run away, it can't follow us, but I won't back down. We just have to fight like we've never fought before!","How strong is this guy? He has more HP than anyone else we've fought, so we'll have to fight harder than we've ever fought before! It can't catch us if we run away, but who knows what he could do if we left him alone?"

The way he sees it, the Tournament was made for single combat, and allowing two person teams completely went against the point of that. His anger at this change reached its height when he was defeated by a team and lost his title for the first time after he got it. After winning his title back, he would disappear, taking the Champion Ribbon with him.",KeruDefault_TournamentChampion,WilexDefault_TournamentChampion,LunaDefault_TournamentChampion
Slime,Slime,"A very common creature in the Gemstone Islands. They are naturally curious creatures, so they will usually approach anyone who comes near them. Anything they're curious about ends up being covered in slime, since they often jump into things to get a better look at them.","Slimes are pretty weak, but they have two different ways of stomping. Their higher stomp will deal Water damage and their normal stomp does normal damage. They are somewhat weak to electrical attacks.","These little guys don't look very strong, but they can still stomp us pretty hard. They are weak to electrical attacks, so it's probably a good time for an Electro Stomp.",LunaDefault_Slime
Slimewalker,Slimewalker,A Slime that has taken a form similar to the jellyfish in the Gemstone Islands.,"These slimes look like the jellyfish in the Gemstone Islands, and they sometimes try to mimic them. They can attack by slashing with a sharp tentacle or by shooting a slime ball. Their slime ball attack will target the one that will take the most damage from it, so defensive boosts may not be helpful here.","It looks like a jellyfish, but it's actually just another slime. They can slash us or shoot slime at us. They must be pretty smart, since they will shoot their slime at whichever of us will take the most damage.",LunaDefault_Slimewalker
Slimeworm,Slimeworm,A strange creature that anchors itself in place to draw nutrients from the ground. They are almost never seen outside of their anchored state. They launch water bombs out of their tail in order to defend themselves.,"Slimeworms are large creatures that draw nutrients from the ground to empower themselves. They can charge to give themselves Focus and Absorb, and they will shoot large slime balls after charging. They also have thick skin that gives them high defense.","These worms have high defense, so I probably need to Focus to be able to hit them hard enough. It looks like these guys have the same idea, since they keep doing charge attacks.","They're too tall for me to stomp on, so I'll have to use my hammer on them. Their defense is pretty high, so I might have to Power Smash them."
Slimebloom,Slimebloom,"A strange flower-like creature made of slime. Similar to Slimeworms, they anchor themselves in place to draw nutrients from the ground. However, they have weaker attacks since they are much smaller.","They are not actually flowers, but they still draw energy from the ground. You should be careful to block their attacks, since they can paralyze you or put you to sleep. Their tentacles are also electrified, so you shouldn't stomp on them. Strangely, they are weak to being paralyzed despite being immune to electricity.","Weird looking flowers… Those tentacles are electrified so electrical attacks won't work on them. They can paralyze us if we're not careful, and they can also lob sleepy slime at us. We better get rid of them fast so they can't paralyze us or put us to sleep. They're weak to being paralyzed, so maybe we should give them a taste of their own medicine.","I can't tell if these are flowers or not… Getting a closer look is probably a bad idea since their tentacles are electrified. They can zap and paralyze us, and they can also lob slime balls at us to put us to sleep. We should get rid of them so they can't do that."
SirenFish,Siren Fish,"These strange fish are always covered in slime, which often forms into bubbles that they use to fly and attack enemies.","These fish are covered in slime, so they should be called Slimefish. But I suppose that the Gemstone Islands already have a lot of slimy enemies… Their main attack is blowing sedative bubbles at you. They can also empower all their allies, so you should take care of them quickly. However, they can't boost their allies if they're grounded so that is another way to stop them from boosting everyone.","Seems like everything in this place is covered in slime, and this guy is no different. They can blow bubbles at us to put us to sleep, and they can also boost everyone by singing a song. They can't sing while on the ground so I better get them down when I can.",LunaDefault_SirenFish

Blazecrest,Blazecrest,"Blazecrests are the strongest of the Flamecrests. They use their natural capabilities to fight enemies, seeing weapon users as weaklings who can't really fight. Their scales give them some defense, but they are weak to water attacks. Blazecrests often see themselves as the ideal form of Flamecrests, since they are the strongest and have the strongest fire breath.<line><line>Their main attack is breathing a massive stream of fire to hit all their enemies at once. They can also roar at enemies to make them Berserk.","Blazecrests use their strong fire breath to hurt you, but they can also roar at you to make you Berserk. They have higher health and higher defense than other Flamecrests, but they have the same water weakness most other Blazecrests have, so water is the best way to beat them.","Their heads are on fire, so obviously water attacks are the way to go here. I should target them first because their fire breath is pretty strong, and their roar attack can make us Berserk.",LunaDefault_Blazecrest
Embercrest,Embercrest,"Embercrests are not as strong as Blazecrests and have much weaker fire breath, only being able to produce smaller fireballs instead of a massive stream of flame. They have slightly less defense than Blazecrests but they still have the same water weakness. Embercrests are the majority of the Flamecrest population, making up roughly 50% of the population.<line><line>They tend to use a sword in addition to their fiery attacks to fight enemies. They usually slash twice with their sword attacks.","Embercrests have a little bit of defense and they use their swords to attack. They use a dual slash pattern to attack, but they can also shoot a fireball to hit someone with Fire damage. Embercrests have the same water weakness most other Flamecrests have, so try using water on them if you can.",Two swords… Don't they know one is enough? They can use both swords to attack or shoot fireballs at us. Water attacks are their weakness but they are also weak to being poisoned.,LunaDefault_Embercrest
Ashcrest,Ashcrest,"Ashcrests are the weakest of the Flamecrests. Unlike other Flamecrests, they are not weak to water, but they are slightly weak to fire attacks instead. Ashcrests are often looked down upon by other Flamecrests because they can't breathe fire at all, and often times their crests aren't even on fire.<line><line>They tend to rely on bomb attacks since they are quite weak physically.","Ashcrests have the lowest health and defense of Flamecrests, but they don't have the same water weakness of other Flamecrests. They are actually slightly weak to fire damage though. They use shock bombs and water bombs to attack instead of attacking directly.","Sneaky little guys… They can't breathe fire, but the bombs they throw are pretty annoying. Each bomb can only hit one of us, with one bomb being a water bomb and another bomb being a shock bomb.

Flametongue,Flametongue,"Strange scaly mammals with very long tongues. Somehow, their tongues are longer than their bodies. They stick out their tongues to burn enemies from a distance.","Flametongues are actually mammals, despite how they look like reptiles. They can burn both of you with their long tongues. Their thick scales give them a lot of defense and makes them almost immune to fire attacks. Defense piercing abilities are a good way of beating them.",Their tongues are really long… How do they fit in their bodies? They attack by licking us which will burn both of us. Their thick scales give them a lot of defense and resists most fire attacks. Piercing attacks are probably the way to go here.,LunaDefault_Flametongue
Heatwing,Heatwing,"Heatwings are fiercely territorial, so they will attack anyone unfamiliar who intrudes on their territory. Their main attacks are swooping down on targets and flapping their wings to burn a large area with their burning wings. Like with many other fiery enemies, water attacks are especially effective against them.","Heatwings are flying reptiles with burning wings. Like many other burning creatures, they are weak to water damage, but you may need to bring them down to use water against them. They can flap their wings to spread fire to hit both of you. Their other method of attack is to swoop down at a target twice.","Another fiery enemy… Water attacks are a good idea, but I'll have to get them down to hit them with them. The fiery wind they can blow with their wings isn't that strong, but they can also swoop down to hit us twice.",LunaDefault_Heatwing
Lavaswimmer,Lavaswimmer,"These large reptiles have perpetually burning scales on their backs that make it dangerous to jump on them. Domesticated Lavaswimmers are often used as a source of leather, meat and eggs. However, wild Lavaswimmers often have stronger flames on their backs, which are better suited for making the infinitely burning leather that inhabitants of the Caldera wear.","Lavaswimmers are covered in burning scales that make it dangerous to come into contact with them. This is their main defense mechanism, as their attacks are somewhat weak. They can bite you and they can also shoot fireballs at you. They aren't weak to water, but electric attacks are very effective against them, so that is a good way to beat them.","These big guys have pretty weak attacks, but they can shoot fireballs at us. They have burning skin, which gives them a little bit of defense and makes them immune to fire. They're weak to electricity and paralysis, so that might be a way to beat them faster.",LunaDefault_Lavaswimmer

EyeSpore,Eye Spore,"Eye Spores are small fungal spores that can move on their own that can only grow in the darkness of the Shrouded Valley. These spores can infect targets to turn them into spore zombies. However, outsiders are usually immune to the spores, and the spore infection can only take hold if the target actually dies, so they will try their best to focus on the weakest enemy.<line><line>Eye spores attack by shooting small spore balls at targets. They are weak to Fire and Earth damage.","The Shrouded Valley is full of these unsettling creatures. They focus most of their attacks on the enemy with the lowest health, and their attacks get stronger when you have less health. Make sure you keep your health as high as possible. Fire and Earth are their main weaknesses so you should use those damage types to beat them quickly.","I don't like how they're looking at me… They will try to hit whoever has the lowest health, and their attacks are a lot stronger when we have less health. We should get rid of them before our hp gets too low. Fire attacks are one of their weaknesses, so that's what I should do to beat them.","These things are creepy! They will hit us a lot harder when we're at low hp, so I should make sure to keep our HP up. I can also use Earth damage to get rid of them fast."
SpikeShroom,Spike Shroom,"These mushrooms are extremely spiky, and their spikes can inflict poison on attackers. Their spikes are very stiff, giving them high defense. Spike Shrooms will try to poke creatures they sense in order to spread their spores. They are weak to Electric and Earth damage.",KeruDefault_SpikeShroom,"All those spikes are make it hard to get a good hit on them, but electricity will still work pretty well. I won't get poked by the spikes if I Electro Stomp them, so that's probably the way to beat these things.",LunaDefault_SpikeShroom
Shrouder,Shrouder,"A spore creature that has absorbed some of the illusory power of the Shrouded Valley. This allows them to hide their allies from attacks. These creatures are mostly hollow on the inside, making them buoyant enough to fly.<line><line>They attack by spreading large clouds of spores to weaken enemies. They can only shroud their allies while they're flying.","These are one of the more insidious creatures of the Shrouded Valley. Shrouders can hide their allies from your attacks, and they can blow clouds of spores that make it harder to use moves. Make sure you remove them first or else you'll be fighting an uphill battle.",Shrouders can hide our enemies from attacks and blow dark clouds that make it harder for us to move. Great. I better get rid of it first so it can't hide anyone from our attacks.,LunaDefault_Shrouder
HoarderFly,Hoarder Fly,"These creatures can convert the dark energy of the Valley into healing light, but they hoard this energy instead of using it. Their hoarding instinct is strong enough that they won't even heal themselves as that would cut into their hoard of energy. A small amount of their energy leaks out when they attack, but their venom means that getting bit intentionally is a bad idea.","Hoarder Flies have healing magic, but they almost never use it willingly. Their bites will heal you for a small amount, but their bites have some venom that will poison you. They can also swoop down on you multiple times to do damage normally.","Apparently they have healing abilities, but they usually keep it all to themselves, which is pretty good for us. They will fight pretty viciously to defend their hoard of healing energy though. Their bites heal us a tiny amount but also poisons us, and they can also swoop down on us multiple times. We should get rid of it first so it can't poison us.",LunaDefault_HoarderFly
Mosquito,Mosquito,"Mosquitos distrust almost everyone they come across, as it is very hard to tell if someone is a spore zombie. Creatures from outside the Shrouded Valley are usually immune to the spores, but the Mosquitos are still suspicious of them. Their weapon of choice is needles, which they use to weaken opponents.

Shimmerwing,Shimmerwing,"These birds have sparkling feathers that resembles the snowy ground of the Radiant Plateau, so they are often quite hard to see when they're on the ground.<line><line>Their main attack is to screech loudly in order to dazzle their enemies.

Their light based attacks can hit Ethereal targets.",KeruDefault_LumistarVanguard,"Their horn blasts really hurt my ears… Hiding from their attacks doesn't even work either. They have a stronger horn blast and a weaker horn blast that also boosts the defense of all their allies. The only good things about them are that they don't have as much health as the other soldiers, and water attacks are stronger against them.",LunaDefault_LumistarVanguard
LumistarSoldier,Lumistar Solider,"These large, bulky soldiers are one of the core elements of Lumistar's army. The armor is too heavy for tiercels and sparrows to wear, so Lumistar Soliders are almost always female hawks and polar bears.<line><line>They usually focus on making powerful sword slices, as their armor prevents them from making delicate movements. They can charge up to do an even stronger sword slash.",KeruDefault_LumistarSoldier,"That heavy armor slows down their attacks, but they still hurt a lot.

LumistarStriker,Lumistar Striker,"These small, nimble fighters form the main part of Lumistar's army.

KingIlum,King Ilum,"The current king of Lumistar. He took power under strange circumstances after his brother was declared unfit to be King, and this uncertainty about his legitimacy has made many people wary about him.

Although, his supporters say that his brother was a weak king, who always gave up too much ground to others.","I was hoping to avoid a diplomatic incident, but it seems like we're way past that point. Ilum is a skilled swordfighter who has many different sword attacks. After taking some damage he will start to use empowering moves and charge attacks. He has a normal charge attack and a light beam charge attack. You can only hide from the normal charge attack, so you should pay attention to how he charged up.","You're gonna pay for throwing me in the dungeon!

TyrantBlade,Tyrant Blade,"Ilum's claim to legitimacy came from the royal sword Light's Edge, whose power can only be wielded by the true ruler of Lumistar.

Coiler,Coiler,"Coilers are snails with conductive metal on their shells that allows them to store immense amounts of electrical energy to do strong electrical attacks.
