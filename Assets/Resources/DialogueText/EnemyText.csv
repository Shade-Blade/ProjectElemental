DebugEntity,Debug Entity,"This text should not appear as the Debug Entity is not supposed to appear in any battles or appear in the Bestiary. This could happen if the game fails to parse a certain EntityID as DebugEntity is the default in the enum (0). Although, you can also see this text by hacking or datamining the game. If you're a hacker or dataminer, then you should probably stop.","This doesn't look right, we should report this as a bug.","Oh, look. The game is broken. Sounds like someone didn't test the game enough for bugs.",I don't know what that is… Maybe something's wrong with the game?
Leafling,Leafling,"A small, common mammal native to the Verdant Forests, although they are also found in the Solar Grove.<line><line>Despite being small, they have a ravenous appetite. Travellers should steer clear of them so the Leaflings don't mistake them for a meal.","Leaflings are pretty weak, so you shouldn't have much trouble with them. Try not to let them chew on you if you can.",Leaflings are really annoying. All they do is chew on everything they see. Good thing they're easy to get rid of.,These cute little rascals love nibbling on everything they see.  Maybe we can keep one? I don't think Wilex would like that though.
Flowerling,Flowerling,"These relatives of Leaflings are known for their ability to fly. The propeller flowers on their heads are quite delicate, so attacking them will render the Flowerling unable to fly for the rest of battle.<line><line>Like regular Leaflings, they are constantly searching for an easy meal, so travellers should be careful around them.","Flowerlings can fly high enough that you need to jump on them. When you hit them, they'll fall down and won't be able to fly back up for the rest of battle.","It's pretty much just a flying Leafling. Once I stomp on it, the flower will break and it won't fly anymore.",I can't get high enough to reach it… Maybe Wilex can jump up to it?
Shrublet,Shrublet,"This variant of the Leafling is covered in rough thorns and has a stronger bite, although it has slightly lower health than regular Leaflings. A layer of thorns on their body makes it dangerous to come into contact with them.<line><line>It is advisable to try to attack them with weapons instead of making contact with them directly, despite how effective direct attacks may be.","Shrublets are covered in thorns, so you shouldn't stomp on them. Stomping will still hurt them, but you'll get hurt too. Make sure you hit them from a distance with your weapon. You should focus on them first, since their bites are somewhat strong.","It's covered in thorns and has a pretty strong bite, so I better get rid of them first. Stomping on them is gonna hurt, but I might not have a choice. It'll hurt less than being chomped on, I guess.","Those thorns look pretty painful… I should try hitting them from a distance. Good thing I have a hammer! Their bites hurt a lot, so we should focus on getting rid of them first."
Rootling,Rootling,"The guardian of the Soul Crown in the Solar Grove, who is the young child of the previous guardian. While it is much weaker than the previous guardian, it is still quite large and powerful. Similar to Leaflings, the Rootling has a large appetite, made even larger by its massive size.<line><line>The Rootling will often dig underground to evade attackers, as well as to prepare for a stronger attack when it emerges.","This is the guardian of the Solar Grove. It doesn't look like you have a way around fighting it... When it hides underground, it's preparing to do a stronger attack, so that is your best time to heal or prepare yourself.","Looks like this is what's guarding the shrine in this place. Doesn't seem like it's that strong though. I can't hit it when it goes underground, so that's a good time to Focus.","Sorry we have to do this, but we really have to get through! When it goes underground, it looks like it's preparing for something big, so I should make sure we're ready for that."
Sunflower,Sunflower,"Sunflowers are stronger versions of Flowerlings that have flaming flowers. Their flowers are very good at absorbing sunlight, and that energy is used to fuel the flame. The flame can burn anyone trying to attack them directly.<line><line>Sunflowers rarely need to hunt for food as most of their energy comes from absorbing the sun's rays, yet they are still quite aggressive regardless. Unlike regular Flowerlings, they can quickly recover from being grounded.","This is a flaming version of normal Flowerlings. You'll get burned if you try to jump on them, so you should find another way to deal with them.<next>They're better at flying than normal Flowerlings, so hitting them down will only ground them until their next turn.","Flying and burning… That's a dangerous combination. If I stomp on them, they will come down, but I'll get burned if I do that.<next>Maybe I should try getting them down a different way…","I already have a hard time with flying things, but now this guy is burning too, so Wilex can't stomp on them without getting hurt. Maybe there's something I can do to get them down…"
Sunnybud,Sunnybud,"A stronger variation of Honeybuds that lives in the deeper parts of the Solar Grove. They are more adept at absorbing sunlight than Honeybuds, which gives them stronger attacks and better healing.<line><line>Their improved healing allows them to stay airborne after healing, and they can also get off the ground and heal on the same turn.","This is a Sunnybud, a stronger version of the Honeybud. They have stronger attacks and stronger healing. Unlike Honeybuds, hitting them down to the ground won't stop them from healing on their turn.","Looks like they can heal every turn, unlike Honeybuds. I can't even stop them from healing since they can get up and heal on the same turn.<next>I better get rid of them first so they stop that.","They really like sharing their honey with everyone. Why don't they share it with us? They can still heal even if they get hit down, so we should focus on them first."
MiracleBloom,Miracle Bloom,"The strongest and rarest variation of Honeybuds. They have extremely powerful healing and powerful attacks.<line><line>Like Sunnybuds, Miracle Blooms can heal their allies and still stay in the air, allowing them to heal their allies for multiple turns in a row. They can also get off the ground and heal on the same turn.<line><line>Miracle Blooms are the only source of the rare Miracle Syrup.","Miracle Blooms are the strongest form of Honeybuds. Their attacks are very strong, and they can heal their allies for a lot of HP.",Apparently their honey is really good at healing. Maybe I should take some for myself if I can. I should get rid of them first so they can't use it all up on their allies.,I bet their honey tastes really great. We'll have to focus on them first to get some though.
SunSapling,Sun Sapling,"The older form of the Rootling. At this stage of its life, the Sun Sapling rarely leaves the hole it buried itself in, although it can still leave it in emergencies.<line><line>The Sun Sapling gets most of its energy through absorbing sunlight through its leaves. This energy allows them to regenerate rapidly, and it can also share its energy with others to boost their power.<line><line>The Sun Sapling will also call forth other sun powered creatures to protect itself as well.","This is what the Rootling will grow up to be. Its leaves let it regenerate quickly and allows it to boost itself and its allies. It will keep calling allies as long as it's still alive.<next>If you're having trouble keeping up with doing more damage than it regenerates, then you chould try charging up to do all the damage you need to do as fast as possible.","It regenerates pretty fast and it keeps calling allies for help…Oh great. I should focus on doing damage faster than it can regenerate, or else we won't be getting anywhere.<next>One of the things it summons can heal it though, so I should get rid of them too.","Wow, it's so big! It looks like it can regenerate pretty fast and summon some friends every so often. Everything it summons is flying, so Wilex should handle them.<next>Then I should focus on making sure we do damage faster than it can heal itself, but I might need Wilex's help for that too."
Rockling,Rockling,"This is a rocky variant of the Leafling. Instead of being covered in leaves, this variant is covered with a rocky shell that gives them higher defense yet lower health. Outside of that, they are quite similar to regular Leaflings, as they still tend to bite anything that comes near them.","Rocklings are a version of Leaflings with a rocky shell instead of leaves covering them. The rock armor gives them some defense, but other than that they are the same as Leaflings.",Stomping won't do much against that rocky shell of theirs. Slashing still works for some reason. Maybe I can try Focusing if that still isn't enough.,"It's covered in rocks, so stomping on it won't work. This looks like a job for my Hammer. Maybe I'll have to Power Smash if my hammer isn't doing enough."
Honeybud,Honeybud,"A variation of Flowerlings native to the Verdant Forest. The flower on its head produces honey, which it can use to heal its allies.<line><line>Healing allies is a strenuous process, which renders them grounded for a short time. They are also incapable of healing from the ground.<line><line>Unlike Flowerings, they can quickly get up off the ground on their turn. The honey can also be extracted to use as a food source.","Honeybuds can fly and heal their allies using the flower on their head. Like with Flowerlings, you can hit them to make them fall down, but they can fly back up on their turn.<next>When they're in the air, they can heal their allies with honey, but they fall down after healing.","It's a flying healer, so I better focus on it first. They can't heal from the ground, so I should keep them down.<next>Sharing their honey will make them fall down, but they can get back up again pretty quickly.","The honey they make seems tasty, but they only share it with their own allies, so I should probably stop that.<next>There's not a lot I can do while they're flying, but they fall down every time they heal. Then it's my time to strike!"
BurrowTrap,Burrow Trap,"Burrow Traps are carnivorous plants that can burrow down and come up in different places. They often try to take their prey by surprise, by emerging right next to them. Pollen from their bites makes their prey dizzy, making it harder for them to escape or fight back.<line><line>If they are attacked, they will retaliate with an attack stronger and faster than normal. Killing them won't stop them from countering, as they will get one last hit before dying.","Burrow Traps attack by biting you and covering you in pollen. The pollen makes you Dizzy for a short time, so you probably want to take care of them first if you aren't good at blocking.<next>However, they will retaliate whenever you hit them, so you should try to use your strongest attacks on them to get rid of them more quickly. They will always be able to make at least one counter attack though, no matter how hard you hit them.","They really want to get their pollen in our eyes, and they also counter when they get hit, so I should hit them as hard as I can. But even if I do that, they'll still get one more counter in before they die.","Yuck! They really like getting their pollen everywhere! That pollen makes it hard for us to see, and they will also fight back when we hit them. Let's give them everything we got!"
Sundew,Sundew,"Sundews are strange plants that produce sticky poison droplets on the ends of their tentacles. They will lob these droplets at anyone who gets near them.<line><line>Attacking them will also cause them to retaliate, so care must be taken when trying to remove them. Killing them won't stop them from fighting back, as they will get one last attack in.","Sundews attack by fling sticky droplets towards you. Those droplets inflict Poison, so you should try your best to avoid them.<next>Attacking them will make them retaliate, so you should try to use your strongest attacks on them to get rid of them more quickly. They will always be able to make at least one counter attack though, no matter how hard you hit them.","I better avoid those poison droplets they keep throwing around. They strike back when they get hurt, so I should hit them as hard as I can. But even if I kill them in one hit, they still get one last counter attack.","I really don't want that poison in my fur, so I should try avoiding their attacks. They fight back when they get hit though, so I should hit them as hard as possible."
VinePlatform,Vine Platform,"A stiff bundle of vines sturdy enough to stand on, an example of Sycamore's plant manipulation powers. While the vines can't attack on their own, they help Sycamore use stronger abilities than he would have on the ground.","It's a platform made from magical vines. It can't do much of anything on its own, but you should still bring it down since Sycamore is stronger while standing on it.","It's just a platform, so it can't really do much. Sycamore is stronger on top of it, so I better cut it down soon.","The platform can't do much on its own, but breaking it will make Sycamore fall down. I can't reach him when he's high up so I'll have to break the platform."
Sycamore,Sycamore,"Sycamore is a man of principle, with deep reverence for the messages the forest sends him. If the forest tells him to tear down a settlement, he will do that without hesitation.<line><line>His family naturally has plant related magic, and so they naturally have leadership over those aligned with the Stonewood Temple.","This is Sycamore, one of the leaders of Stonewood Temple. He has the power to manipulate plants to attack. Once he is hurt enough, he will summon some plant allies to help him and he will stand on a raised vine platform. You should try to get him down if you can, since he has stronger attacks while on that platform.","He must've gone crazy, thinking the plants are talking to him. Either that, or he's just making that up for an excuse to do whatever he wants. Anyway, he has plant magic which lets him attack us with plants or summon plants to fight for him. When he gets hurt enough, he'll get up onto a vine platform that we'll need to cut down.",LunaDefault_Sycamore
GiantVine,Giant Vine,"A massive vine summoned by the Master of Autumn. The powerful earth magic coursing through it gives it massive strength, allowing it to pick up and restrain those that would harm the Master. However, it always takes some preparation for it to grab someone, meaning that there is always an opportunity to prevent someone from being grabbed. If someone is grabbed by the vine, they will be restrained until the vine is destroyed or the person dies.","This large vine can slam into you but it can also grab you after a short time. The vine seems to have a short delay before trying to grab someone, so that's when you should really focus your attention on them.","It's definitely looking at me funny, even though it doesn't even have eyes. I better cut it down before it tries anything. Luna better get me out if I get grabbed by this thing…","That's one big vine! It looks like it's strong enough to pick us up, so we should get rid of it before it can do that. Hopefully Wilex will save me if I get grabbed."
VineThrone,Vine Throne,"A massive vine throne summoned by the Master of Autumn. The vines on top form a protective shell around the one on the throne, making it impossible to target the one inside without destroying the throne first.","The Vine Throne protects the Master of Autumn from all attacks. You will need to destroy it to get to him. However, you shouldn't ignore the Giant Vines since they can grab you and take you out of the fight.",Nothing can get to the Master of Autumn while this Throne is around. I'll have to cut it down fast. But I should make sure the Giant Vines don't grab me before I can destroy it…,"The Throne keeps the Master of Autumn safe from all attacks, so we need to get rid of it to get to him. But those Giant Vines are also pretty dangerous, so I'll have to get rid of them too."
MasterOfAutumn,Master of Autumn,"Where spring is seen as a season of growth and beginnings, autumn is seen as a season of death and endings. Sycamore's responsibilities are a reflection of that, as he is the one who ensures that the plants and animals of the forest do not die unnecessarily, being the one who fights those who would defile the forest.<line><line> His plant manipulation power has become much stronger, allowing him to summon massive vines in order to attack and trap anyone who would attack him. The throne he summons will fully protect him from any harm, and also give him access to stronger attacks.","This is a form of Sycamore empowered by the magic of the seasons. It looks like he can summon much stronger vines to defend himself, being able to summon Giant Vines and a Vine Throne. Like his original form, he is much stronger while on the Vine Throne, so make sure you destroy the throne as fast as you can. However, the Giant Vines can grab you and take you out of the fight, so you will need to destroy them quickly as well.","This guy can summon vines like last time, but they're a lot bigger now. The platform he makes will make him impossible to attack, so I better cut that down when he summons it. But I should also pay attention to the giant vines he summons too, since those can pick us up.",LunaDefault_Harvestborn
Bandit,Bandit,"These frogs have large ears, allowing them to notice potential targets from further away. Regular bandits like these use short swords as their signature weapon, and they often try to catch their targets off guard with a feint before they strike. Bandits have a strong sense of comradery, always looking out for each other, making sure their spoils are divided fairly.","I've had a few too many encounters with these bandits. They roam the desert preying upon anyone who isn't one of them. Make sure you pay attention to their attacks, since they may try to fake you out.","They picked the wrong guy to mess with. They can do a fake out with their swords, so I should watch out for that.","We're not gonna let them get a hand on our stuff! Their swords are pretty hard to keep track of, so I gotta pay close attention to them."
Renegade,Renegade,"Spiky frogs usually become outcasts due to their threatening appearance. Pointy spines all over their back and head make it dangerous to get too close to them, while also giving them some defense. They also have sharp claws for attacking, and they can sometimes use a two hit attack.<line><line>Most spiky frogs tend not to wear much clothing, since most clothing would be torn up by the spines on their back.","Renegades have higher health and defense than normal frogs thanks to their spiky backs. Those spikes make them dangerous to stomp on, so you should hit them from a distance. They can attack by slashing with their claws, sometimes hitting twice instead of once.","All those spikes give them some defense, so I might need to Focus to get through that. They can do a double slash with their claws, so I should block that if I can.","Those spikes are pretty menacing, so I should use my hammer on them. I might need to do some Power Smashes since their defense is pretty high."
Sentry,Sentry,"Sentries are frogs with the ability to inflate themselves and fly. They become electrified while airborne, so it is a good idea to attack them from a distance.<line><line>They attack by slinging rocks from above. Attacking them will provoke a paralyzing counter attack. Sentries usually focus their attention on the most vulnerable targets.","These frogs can blow themselves up like balloons to fly in the air, and they become electrified while airborne. They attack by tossing rocks at you with slings, but they will try to aim at whoever has the lowest health. They can also counter attacks made against them with a paralyzing rock, so you should hit them with strong attacks to defeat them quickly.","They always try to hit whoever's weakest, unless they're doing a counter attack. Taking them down is pretty hard since they're electrified when they're blown up, and electric attacks don't even work on them. I'll also have to deal with their paralyzing counter attack if I get them down.","They look so funny when they're all blown up, but they get electrified when they do that. Maybe there's a way I can hit them without getting hurt myself? Hitting them will make them hit back with a paralyzing rock, so I better be careful of that."
Cactupole,Cactupole,"These strange creatures inflate themselves in order to disguise themselves as floating cacti. Cactupoles have electrified skin when they fly, making them dangerous to come into contact with.<line><line>They have a lot of difficulty moving while inflated, so they have to deflate themselves to attack.<line><line>Their main predators are Sandswimmers, who can sense the electric fields they give off.","These tadpoles have hard skin and thorns that give them high defense and makes them look like cacti. They can inflate themselves to fly, and their attacks are more dangerous when they're in the air, since they can paralyze you. However, they have to come down to attack you, so you can try to wait for that time to strike. Their thorns make them dangerous to jump on, so be careful when dealing with them.","A flying cactus… Seems annoying to deal with. At least they'll fall down to the ground when they attack, so I should wait for that to happen.","I thought it was a normal cactus for a moment… Getting hit by their thorns will paralyze us, so we should try to avoid that. When they're flying I can't do too much to them, but they'll come down on their own, so I should wait for that."
Sandswimmer,Sandswimmer,"Sandswimmers are strange mammals that can swim through the sand like water. Their large bills allow them to sense electrical fields, which helps lead them towards potential food sources.<line><line>Their electrified skin makes them shocking to the touch, and also makes them immune to electrical attacks. The bandits in the desert occasionally use tamed Sandswimmers to help chase down their targets.","Sandswimmers are bulky beasts with high health but low attack. Try not to get bitten by them, since their bites can paralyze you. Their electrified skin gives them some defense and makes them immune to electrical attacks themselves. You shouldn't stomp on them, since you'll get shocked on contact.","These big beasts have pretty weak attacks, but they can paralyze us with their bites. They have shocking skin, which gives them a little bit of defense and makes them immune to electricity. Looks like I should use my sword for this one.",LunaDefault_Sandswimmer

DesertBossGuy,Flight,"The leader of the desert bandits. His family once all lived in Windspire, but now his family is split, with half of them following Flight in becoming a part of the bandits.<line><line>Flight plans on using the Storm Cannon to take control of Windspire.",KeruDefault_DesertBossGuy,WilexDefault_DesertBossGuy,LunaDefault_DesertBossGuy
StormCannon,Storm Cannon,"An ancient weapon used to bring the Air Dragon, Electrion out of the sky. It shoots out the electrical energy stored within to attack, and it can draw some energy from the environment.<line><line>However, the energy used to bring down Electrion came from the dragon himself, and so after his death there is now no way for the cannon to reach its maximum potential. Although, the power of the Air Core can still charge the cannon enough to be devastating.",KeruDefault_StormCannon,"It's a big hunk of metal that shoots lightning at us. We're probably better off focusing on taking down Flight, since this thing has a lot of defense and higher health than him.",LunaDefault_StormCannon
Stormtamer,Stormtamer,"Stormhole began as a group of outcasts who were rejected and forced out of the cities in the desert. As they didn't have the favor of Electrion, most of them had to scavenge and steal supplies from traders in the desert in order to survive, giving rise to the Stormhole Bandits. The ultimate robbery of theirs would be to kill Electrion and take his power for themselves. The bandits built a cannon capable of using the great dragon's power against him, and struck him down with ease. Unfortunately, his death would render most of their settlement uninhabitable due to the energy he released, as well as the eternal storms that now perpetually surround Stormhole.",KeruDefault_Stormtamer,WilexDefault_Stormtamer,LunaDefault_Stormtamer
Stormkiller,Stormkiller,"The ancient cannon, now charged with an immense amount of energy. It takes some time to charge up, with the charging being interruptable. However, it can fortify itself, making it very difficult to prevent its ultimate attack from being used. The ultimate attack is unavoidable and impossible to survive, so interrupting its charge is crucial to defeating it.","Whatever you do, you must NOT let the cannon fire. Keep hitting it to reduce its level of charge. Its defense will increase every turn, so you need to defeat the cannon or the Stormtamer as fast as you can.","There's a lot of energy in that thing. Getting hit by it will probably kill us, so I need to stop it from firing by hitting it hard. Electric attacks won't work since it will just absorb them. Still, we're better off trying to take down the guy on top since the cannon has a lot more defense than him. We need to be fast about this fight, since this thing will keep getting more defense every turn, so eventually we won't be able to stop it from firing anymore.","It's bright and sparking, but that's probably a bad thing. I don't think I want this thing to fire on us, so I think we should keep hitting it so it won't attack."
TrainingDummy,Dummy,"An ordinary training dummy. This dummy has been around from the very beginning of the Tournament , and yet it appears almost completely undamaged.","It's a normal training dummy. I don't think you need to worry about breaking it, since the other Tournament fighters probably used it before.","Just a normal training dummy… It can survive anything we throw at it though. We don't need any training though, so we don't need this thing.","Did they have to give it a cute face like that? I feel kinda bad attacking it… Well it doesn't seem to mind, so I think it should be fine."
TrainingDummyBoss,Dummy?,"It seems that the dummy was inhabited by a magical spirit deep within it. The immense power of the spirit kept the dummy from being damaged, but the spirit would lay dormant until someone peered deep inside the dummy to awaken it.<line><line>The existence of this spirit raises an important question: Are there others like it hiding elsewhere in the world?","What!? How did I not see this power before? Okay, it looks like whatever possessed the dummy can't move around, so if you run away, it can't stop you. You need to get out of there, I don't see any way you could win this.","I knew there was something wrong with the face of this thing… It has more HP than anything else we've fought, so this is going to take a while. If we run away, it can't follow us, but I won't back down. We just have to fight like we've never fought before!","How strong is this guy? He has more HP than anyone else we've fought, so we'll have to fight harder than we've ever fought before! It can't catch us if we run away, but who knows what he could do if we left him alone?"
TournamentPawn,Boulder,"Boulder has always lived in the shadow of his older siblings, and so he has always wanted to prove himself stronger than them by carving his own path. However, his time in the tournament has been a long string of losses with only a small handful of victories, keeping him at the bottom of the rankings. His determination hasn't been shaken by this however, and so he is willing to give it his all to finally rise above the bottom and defeat someone.","Boulder's losing streak is impressive, as much as it is sad. You would think that a losing streak like that would humble him, but he is very stubborn and arrogant, unwilling to change his fighting style or improve.","He keeps using the same stomping attack over and over. No wonder he's losing every time. But I guess he has some pretty strong dedication, I probably would have dropped out of the tournament if I lost as much as he has.","Poor guy… Maybe we should let him win this one. No? Well, it doesn't look like he'll do anything other than stomp us, so this should be a simple fight."
TournamentKnight,Lance,"Lance is an eccentric fighter who relies a lot on his agility, being able to dodge a lot of his opponent's attacks, and also being able to attack very suddenly. While he may not be able to survive many hits against himself, a fluke upset against some of the higher ranking fighters has shown that his style isn't something that can be taken lightly.",KeruDefault_TournamentKnight,"It's hard to land a hit on him, so I'll have to pay attention to his stance. He gets a turn every time we move, so we should just keep trying to hit him as hard as we can.","So fast… He keeps zipping around to dodge my attacks. Maybe I can try to catch him off guard by attacking a certain way? He gets to attack every time we move, so we should just try to keep attacking him every turn."

TournamentQueenB,Glaive,"Glaive was a member of the first 2 person team allowed to compete in the Windspire Tournament. Some thought that this was due to corruption, as her brother is the mayor of Windspire. Yet this is likely not the case, as Halberd appears to have little to no interest in the tournament.

TournamentKing,Crest,"The brother of the first champion, Crest has a fast and versatile attacking style that has led him to victory countless times, even against teams of fighters.",KeruDefault_TournamentKing,WilexDefault_TournamentKing,LunaDefault_TournamentKing
TournamentChampion,Summit,"The original champion of the Windspire Tournament. He left the tournament soon after the very first two person team entered the tournament.  From his perspective, allowing teams to compete would let weaklings take the title of Champion. His anger at this change reached its height when he was defeated by a team and lost his title for the first time after he got it. After winning his title back, he would disappear, taking the Champion Ribbon with him.","He's the original champion of the tournament. Even after all this time in hiding, he still hits extremely hard. You will need to watch his attacks closely, as they will do a lot more damage if you fail to block them. He also has the ability to block your attacks if you don't do them correctly. His fighting style is one where he often does massive attacks that make him need to recover after doing them, so you should use that downtime to prepare yourself for his next moves.","""Real champion""? Yeah, right. Like you're anything but a coward for hiding up here. He hits hard, but blocking works better than normal against his attacks. If I mess up my attacks, he'll block them completely too. After his bigger moves he'll take some time to recover, so I should watch out for those.","He looks a lot bigger than his brother, but he's been staying up here alone for a long time. I'll need to stay focused, since all his attacks will hurt a lot more if I don't block. He'll even block my attacks if I mess them up too. His bigger attacks make him tired when he does them, so maybe that's a good time to heal myself."
Slime,Slime,"A very common creature in the Gemstone Islands. They are naturally curious, so they will usually approach anyone who comes near them. Anything they're curious about ends up being covered in slime, since they often jump into things to get a better look at them.","Slimes are pretty weak, but they have two different ways of stomping. Their higher stomp will deal Water damage while their lower stomp does normal damage. They are somewhat weak to electrical attacks.","These little guys don't look very strong, but they can still stomp us pretty hard. Electricity is their weakness, so it's a good time for an Electro Stomp.",LunaDefault_Slime
Slimewalker,Slimewalker,"A Slime that has taken a form similar to the jellyfish in the Gemstone Islands. They can launch slime balls at their enemies, which will hit the one who will take more damage from it.","These slimes look like the jellyfish in the Gemstone Islands, and they sometimes try to mimic them. They can attack by slashing with a sharp tentacle or by shooting a slime ball. Their slime ball attack will target the one that will take the most damage from it, so defensive boosts may not be helpful here.","It looks like a jellyfish, but it's actually just another slime. They can slash us or shoot slime balls at us. They must be pretty smart, since they will shoot their slime at whichever of us will take the most damage.",LunaDefault_Slimewalker
Slimeworm,Slimeworm,"A strange creature that anchors itself in place to draw nutrients from the ground. They are almost never seen outside of their anchored state. They launch water bombs out of their tail in order to defend themselves. Their attacks are quite slow, requiring a full turn to prepare themselves to fire.","Slimeworms are large creatures that draw nutrients from the ground to empower themselves. They can charge to give themselves Focus and Absorb, and they will shoot large slime balls after charging. They also have thick skin that gives them high defense.","These worms have high defense, so I probably need to Focus to be able to hit them hard enough. It looks like these guys have the same idea, since they keep doing charge attacks.","They're too tall for me to stomp on, so I'll have to use my hammer on them. I might have to Power Smash them since their defense is pretty high."
Slimebloom,Slimebloom,"A strange flower-like creature made of slime. Similar to Slimeworms, they anchor themselves in place to draw nutrients from the ground. However, they have weaker attacks since they are much smaller. They will attack by throwing balls of water at their target or by firing a lightning bolt at them. Their tentacles are electrified, making direct contact with them dangerous. However, they are weak to Paralyze despite being covered in electricity.","They are not actually flowers, but they still draw energy from the ground. You should be careful to block their attacks, since they can paralyze you or put you to sleep. Their tentacles are also electrified, so you shouldn't stomp on them. Strangely, they are weak to being paralyzed despite being immune to electricity.","Weird looking flowers… Those tentacles are electrified so electrical attacks won't work on them. They can paralyze us if we're not careful, and they can also lob sleepy slime at us. We better get rid of them fast so they can't paralyze us or put us to sleep. They're weak to being paralyzed, so maybe we should give them a taste of their own medicine.","I can't tell if these are flowers or not… Getting a closer look is probably a bad idea since I'll get shocked by their tentacles. They can zap and paralyze us, and they can also lob slime balls at us to put us to sleep. We should get rid of them so they can't do that."
SirenFish,Siren Fish,"These strange fish are always covered in slime, which often forms into bubbles that they use to fly and attack. This is an adaptation to avoid predators, since there aren't any flying predators within the Gemstone Islands or the oceans they usually inhabit. They often sing songs, which can put their enemies to sleep or make their allies stronger.","These fish can fly using bubbles created from the slime on their skin. Their main attack is blowing sedative bubbles at you. They can also empower all their allies, so you should take care of them quickly. However, they can't boost their allies if they're grounded, so that is another way to stop them from boosting everyone.","They're covered in slime... Shouldn't they be called ""Slimefish""? The bubbles they blow can put us to sleep, and they can also sing a song that boosts all their allies. They can't sing while on the ground so I better get them down when I can.",LunaDefault_SirenFish

Blazecrest,Blazecrest,"Blazecrests are the strongest of the Flamecrests. They use their natural capabilities to fight enemies, seeing weapon users as weaklings who can't really fight. Their scales give them some defense, but they are weak to water attacks. The burning crests on their head and their burning clothing means that direct attacks will burn you. Blazecrests often see themselves as the ideal form of Flamecrests, since they are the strongest and have the strongest fire breath.<line><line>Their main attack is breathing a massive stream of fire to hit all their enemies at once. They can also roar at enemies to make them Berserk.","Blazecrests use their strong fire breath to hurt you, but they can also roar at you to make you Berserk. They have higher health than other Flamecrests, but they have the same water weakness most other Blazecrests have, so water is the best way to beat them.","Their heads are on fire, so obviously water attacks are the way to go here. I should beat them first because their fire breath is pretty strong, and their roar attack can make us Berserk.","These hotheads are always looking to pick a fight! A bit of water should help them cool off, so we should try using that kind of attack."
Embercrest,Embercrest,"Embercrests are not as strong as Blazecrests and have much weaker fire breath, only being able to produce smaller fireballs instead of a massive stream of flame. They have more defense than Blazecrests but they still have the same water weakness. Embercrests are the majority of the Flamecrest population, making up roughly 50% of them.<line><line>They tend to use a sword in addition to their fiery attacks to fight enemies. They usually slash twice with their sword attacks.","Embercrests have some defense and they use their swords to attack. They use a dual slash pattern to attack, but they can also shoot a fireball to hit someone with Fire damage. Embercrests have the same water weakness most other Flamecrests have, so try using water on them if you can.","Two swords… Don't they know one is enough? They can use both swords to attack or they can shoot fireballs at us. That armor they're wearing gives them some defense too. Water attacks are a good idea, but poison also works on them.",LunaDefault_Embercrest
Ashcrest,Ashcrest,"Ashcrests are the weakest of the Flamecrests. Unlike other Flamecrests, they are not weak to water, but they are slightly weak to fire attacks instead. Ashcrests are often looked down upon by other Flamecrests because they can't breathe fire at all, and often times their crests aren't even on fire.<line><line>They tend to rely on bomb attacks since they are quite weak physically.","Ashcrests have the lowest health and defense of Flamecrests, but they don't have the same water weakness of other Flamecrests. They are actually slightly weak to fire damage though. They use shock bombs and water bombs to attack instead of attacking directly.","Sneaky little guys… They can't breathe fire, but the bombs they throw are pretty annoying. Each bomb can only hit one of us, with one bomb being a water bomb and another bomb being a shock bomb. They're not weak to water, but fire works fine against them.",LunaDefault_Ashcrest
Flametongue,Flametongue,"Flametongues are an all female species of scaly mammals with very long tongues. Somehow, their tongues are longer than their bodies. They stick out their tongues to burn enemies from a distance.<line><line>Flametongues are found in small numbers all around the Infernal Caldera, but the largest group of them lives on Silver Island.","Flametongues are actually mammals, despite how they're covered in scales. They can burn both of you with their long tongues. Their thick scales give them a lot of defense and makes them almost immune to fire attacks. Electric attacks are a good way of beating them.",Their tongues are really long… How do they fit in their bodies? They attack by licking both of us at the same time to burn us. I'll need to use electrical attacks to get through their thick scales. Paralyzing them also seems like a good idea too.,"These girls are tough, even if they don't have as much health as everything else around here, and that's because of their big scales. They attack by licking us with their long burning tongues. Wilex might have an easier time dealing with them since he has some Electric attacks he can use here."
Heatwing,Heatwing,"Heatwings are fiercely territorial, so they will attack anyone unfamiliar who intrudes on their territory. Their main attacks are swooping down on targets or flapping their wings to burn a large area with their burning wings. Like  many other fiery creatures, water attacks are especially effective against them.","Heatwings are flying reptiles with burning wings. Like many other burning creatures, they are weak to water damage, but you may need to bring them down to use water against them. They can flap their wings to spread fire to hit both of you. Their other method of attack is to swoop down at a target twice.","Another fiery enemy… Water attacks are a good idea, but I'll have to get them down to hit them with one. The fiery wind they can blow with their wings isn't that strong, but they can also swoop down to hit us twice.",LunaDefault_Heatwing

Domesticated Lavaswimmers are often used as a source of leather, meat and eggs.

This is their main defense mechanism, as their attacks are somewhat weak. They can bite you and they can also shoot fireballs at you. They aren't weak to water, but electric attacks are very effective against them, so that is a good way to beat them.","They have pretty weak attacks, but they can shoot fireballs at us.

These spores can infect targets to turn them into spore zombies. However, outsiders are usually immune to the spores, and the spore infection can only take hold if the target actually dies, so they will try their best to focus on vulnerable targets<line><line>Eye spores attack by shooting small spore balls at targets. They are weak to Fire and Earth damage.","If you're feeling like you're being watched down here, there's a good chance it's one of these creatures. They focus most of their attacks on the enemy with the lowest health, and their attacks get stronger when you have less health. Make sure you keep your health as high as possible. Fire and Earth are their main weaknesses so you should use those damage types to beat them quickly.","I don't like how they're looking at me… They will try to hit whoever has the lowest health, and their attacks are a lot stronger when we have less health. We should get rid of them before our hp gets too low. Fire attacks are one of their weaknesses, so that's what I should do to beat them.","They're so creepy! The spore gunk they shoot will hurt a lot more when we have less health, so I should make sure to keep our health up. I can also use Earth damage to get rid of them fast."
SpikeShroom,Spike Shroom,"These mushrooms are balls of very sharp spikes, and their spikes can inflict poison on attackers. Their spikes are very stiff, giving them high defense. Spike Shrooms will try to poke creatures they sense in order to spread their spores. They are weak to Electric and Earth damage.","Spike Shrooms are covered in spikes, like what the name suggests. You should avoid being hit by their spikes, since all of them are filled with poison. Their spikes give them high defense, but Electric or Earth attacks will get rid of them quickly.","All those spikes are make it hard to get a good hit on them, but electricity will still work pretty well. I won't get poked by the spikes if I Electro Stomp them, so that's probably the way to beat these things.",So sharp and pointy… I should get rid of them fast so I don't get poked. They look like they can poison us too. I feel like a Breaker Smash will do a good job at that.
Shrouder,Shrouder,"A spore creature that has absorbed some of the illusory power of the Shrouded Valley. This allows them to hide their allies from attacks. These creatures are mostly hollow on the inside, making them buoyant enough to fly.<line><line>They attack by spreading large clouds of spores to weaken enemies. They can only shroud their allies while airborne, so grounding them is a good way to prevent that.","These are one of the more insidious creatures of the Shrouded Valley. Shrouders can hide their allies from your attacks, and they can blow clouds of spores that make it harder to use skills.

HoarderFly,Hoarder Fly,"These creatures can convert the dark energy of the Valley into healing light, but they hoard this energy instead of using it for the most part.

Their bites will heal you for a small amount, but their bites have some venom that will poison you. They can also swoop down on you multiple times to do damage normally.","Apparently they have healing abilities, but they usually keep it all to themselves, which is pretty good for us.

We should get rid of it first so it can't poison us.",LunaDefault_HoarderFly
Mosquito,Mosquito,"Mosquitos distrust almost everyone they come across, due to their fear of the spore zombies in the Shrouded Valley. A spore infection causes the target to act slightly differently than they normally do, so mosquitos are hyper vigilant for small behavior changes in those they know. Outsiders can't become spore zombies, but Mosquitoes are still paranoid around them. Their weapons of choice are needles, which they use to weaken opponents. They can also drain health from opponents by biting them, and they usually target the one who looks healthiest.","Mosquitoes will try to bite you and suck your blood to heal themselves, but they also have a needle to defend themselves with. Their needle will Paralyze you as well as inflict Sunder which will lower your defense. They tend to target whoever looks healthiest when they're looking for someone to bite. You should take care of them quickly, so they don't heal back the damage you do to them.","Bloodsuckers… They drain our blood to heal themselves, and they try to bite whoever looks healthiest. They also have needles they can use to Paralyze us and lower our defense. Luna doesn't do well around needles, so I should probably help her out with this one.","Why do they have to like needles so much?

Intruders on their territory are likely going to be pecked, but Shieldwings also have an icy screech attack that freezes their enemies. Their feathers are sometimes used to make feather dusters.","Shieldwings have thick, icy feathers that give them high defense but also make them vulnerable to Fire damage. They will usually attack whoever has the most health, but they can also screech at you to Freeze everyone and deal Light damage. The screech will hurt more when you have more health, so healing too much while they're still around may not be a good idea.",WilexDefault_Shieldwing,"Wow, that's a really bulky birdie! It's got a lot of defense, but they're pretty weak to Fire damage. It likes going after whoever has more health, so it'll probably go after me more often."

The sword was first forged using pieces from Lumion's feathers and claws.<line><line>Throughout a ruler's reign, the sword may be stronger or weaker when wielded by them, depending on how well they embody the will of Lumion.

Being from the Realm of Possibility filled his mind with the knowledge and ideals of those in the Realm, allowing him to become a weapons master at a young age.<line><line>However, this is also the reason behind his beliefs, as his frustration with the imperfect world fueled his ambitions to reshape it no matter the cost.",KeruDefault_FinalSuperboss,WilexDefault_FinalSuperboss,LunaDefault_FinalSuperboss
Plaguebud,Plaguebud,"These strange creatures look similar to Leaflings and Flowerlings, but they are much stronger. They can shoot seeds from the flowers on their head and tail to inflict powerful debuffs. The tail flower is more dangerous, as the seeds will do more damage and poison their targets.","Plaguebuds can bite you, but they will usually attack by launching seeds from the flower on their head or the flower on their tail. The tail seed is more dangerous, as it will poison you as well as give every other enemy a chance to lower your defense. The head seed is weaker, but it will give the other enemies a chance to heal themselves and lower your attack when they hit you. They can absorb water damage, but they are weak to fire damage.","Watering them will heal them, so I shouldn't do any water attacks. They have a lot of health and they can shoot seeds at us to let their allies heal by attacking us.",LunaDefault_Plaguebud
Starfish,Starfish,"Starfish appear quite fragile, but their strange structure makes them surprisingly resilient. No matter how hard they are hit, they barely take any damage, but they can only withstand a few of these hits. They bear a resemblance to Strange Tendrils, which suggests that Starfishes could be a juvenile form of Strange Tendrils.<line><line>Starfishes can use many different powerful spread damage attacks that also inflict debuffs.","They look fragile, but Starfish are tougher than they look. No matter how hard you hit them, they barely take any damage, but you can still beat them with only a few hits. Make sure you remove them quickly, since they have strong spread attacks that also inflict debuffs.","They barely have any health, but it looks like I still have to hit it a few times to beat it. Their attacks are really dangerous too, so I should Multislash them as soon as possible.","I don't understand them at all… No matter how hard I hit them, they barely flinch, but they seem pretty fragile though. I think Wilex can deal with them better than I can."
CursedEye,Cursed Eye,"Cursed Eyes have sensitive eyesight, allowing them to see Ethereal targets, but they are vulnerable to bright lights. They will remain airborne now matter how hard they are hit, and they are immune to all negative effects. Their unfocused gaze will deal weaker spread Light damage, while their focused gaze will deal stronger Dark damage. They tend to focus their gaze on those with less health. If they are hit, they will stare down their attacker in retaliation.","These eyeballs usually like to focus their attention on whoever has less health, but they can also use a spread Light attack as well. No matter what you do, you can't bring them down or even inflict negative effects on them. Attacking them provokes a counterattack, so you need to prepared for that.","It's staring me down… I don't like it. They like to focus their attention on whoever seems the most vulnerable. Hiding from it doesn't work, and there's no way to get them down. I'll probably have to deal with them alone, even if it means provoking them to counter me.","There's no way to bring it down, so it would take a lot of Energy for me to get rid of it. Maybe I should focus on helping Wilex."
StrangeTendril,Strange Tendril,"Strange Tendrils can extend very deep underground or underwater, so only a small part of their length is actually visible most of the time, except when they are attacking or coiling up. Their skin gives them high defense and immunity to electricity. However, statuses are very effective against them. Attacking one tendril appears to make nearby tendrils flinch as well, which implies that they are connected, but nobody has been able to determine for sure whether or not they are all actually connected to each other.",KeruDefault_StrangeTendril,"What are these things made of? They have a lot of defense and electrical attacks can't even pierce that. They're really weak to poison though, so maybe that's how I should beat them.",LunaDefault_StrangeTendril
DrainBud,Drain Bud,"Drain Buds are strange flower-like creatures known for their ability to heal from most attacks instead of taking damage. However, they can still be hurt by Light, Fire and Electric attacks. Statuses are also very effective against them. Their main attack is to drain health from opponents by enveloping them, damaging them in a three hit pattern.","Drain Buds can heal from most attacks, but they are weak to Light, Fire and Electric damage. They are also especially weak to statuses as well. Like the name suggests, they will try to drain health from you as their attack.","Hitting them normally will make them heal, so I should try using Fire or Electric attacks on them.",LunaDefault_DrainBud
