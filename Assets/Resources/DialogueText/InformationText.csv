Info_Agility,Agility and Stamina,"Stamina is a secondary resource used to pay for moves alongside Energy. Agility is a stat that determines the rate that you gain stamina, and it is proportional to Max EP.","Stamina is a secondary resource used to pay for moves alongside Energy. Agility is a stat that determines the rate that you gain stamina, and it is proportional to Max EP.<line><line>Agility is calculated by adding 7 to your Max EP and then dividing by a certain factor and then rounding up. This factor is 12 for Wilex and 16 for Luna.<line><line>If you use a move whose stamina cost is higher than your Agility, you won't get any stamina next turn. The character in front also has their agility increased by 50%."
Info_EnemyBehavior,Enemy Behavior,Enemies tend to target the front character twice as often as they target the back character. Enemy behavior also tends to be deterministic.,"Enemies tend to target the front character twice as often as they target the back character.<line><line>Enemy behavior also tends to be deterministic, though their behavior may depend on what other enemies are in the formation and what turn it is, with a few enemies acting different based on your hp."
Info_Curses,Curse Badges,Curse Badges increase the difficulty of the game by multiplying enemy stats by a certain amount and changing their moves in a certain way.,"Curse Badges increase the difficulty of the game by multiplying enemy stats by a certain amount and changing their moves in a certain way.<line><line>More specifically, enemy Max HP, Attack, Coin drops and Experience drops are all multiplied. Attacks are guaranteed to deal at least 1 more damage than with the previous curse level (i.e. with Super Curse, all attacks will deal at least 1 more damage than normal.)<line><line>Boss fights are expected to be barely possible with Mega Curse, requiring very advanced strategy and often requiring grinding to the maximum possible stats you can obtain as well as cooking an inventory full of the best possible items.<line><line>Curse badges can be combined to be stacked together, but this will likely result in many required fights becoming completely impossible."
Info_Exp,Experience,Experience points are earned by defeating enemies of a higher level than you. You level up once you obtain 100 of them.,"Experience points are earned by defeating enemies of a higher level than you. You level up once you obtain 100 of them.<line><line>The amount of experience you get from a certain enemy is proportional to the difference between their level and yours. The experience bonus increases their level in the formula unless your level is equal or greater than theirs.<line><line>Enemies also drop more experience in encounters that start with more enemies.<line><line>The Curse badges will increase the experience enemies give out in proportion to their multiplier. However, each curse badge is guaranteed to add 1 to the experience the enemy gives out if the enemy gives out more than 0 experience."
Info_ContactHazards,Contact Hazards,Contact Hazards deal damage to you when you attack an enemy that has them. The only two types of contact hazards are ones that apply on direct contact and ones that apply on weapon moves.,"Contact Hazards deal damage to you when you attack an enemy that has them. Different types of contact hazards include ones that apply on direct contact and ones that apply on weapon moves.<line><line>Contact hazards can never interrupt your moves, but they can reduce you to 0 hp. Each enemy can only deal contact damage to you once per turn, so a multihit move against a single target will only ever result in you taking damage a single time.<next>However, multitarget moves will result in you taking damage multiple times if you target multiple enemies that have contact hazards."
Info_Resistance,Damage Reduction,"Effects that reduce incoming damage by a certain percentage stack do not stack linearly. Instead, each effect is given a certain number of Resistance Points (0.33 reduction = 1 point, 0.5 reduction = 2 points)","Effects that reduce incoming damage by a certain percentage stack do not stack linearly. Instead, each effect is given a certain number of Resistance Points (0.33 reduction = 1 point, 0.5 reduction = 2 points)<line><line>The formula for damage reduction is (R / (2 + R)) where R is the total number of resistance points you have (so 1 point is a reduction of 33%, 2 points is a reduction of 50% and so on.)"
Info_PaymentResistance,Shield Payment,"Certain damage reduction effects require you to pay with a certain resource for each point of damage reduced. If you have multiple damage reduction effects active, you pay a lower amount.","Certain damage reduction effects require you to pay with a certain resource for each point of damage reduced. If you have multiple damage reduction effects active, you pay a lower amount.<line><line>More specifically, the amount you pay is multiplied by the ratio of how many resistance points are contributed by the effect divided by how many resistance points you have total.<next>For example, suppose you have 4 resistance points with 2 points coming from an effect you have to pay for. If the damage from a certain attack is reduced by 10, then the amount you pay is the same as if the damage was reduced by 5 and you only had the effect you had to pay for"
Info_Status,Statuses,"Statuses are debilitating effects that usually prevent an enemy from moving or severely reduce their capabilities. Statuses are Berserk, Sleep, Paralyze, Dizzy, Freeze and Poison.","Statuses are debilitating effects that usually prevent an enemy from moving or severely reduce their capabilities. Statuses are Berserk, Sleep, Paralyze, Dizzy, Freeze and Poison.<line><line>Enemies can only have one status at a time. Each enemy type can have a different susceptibility to different statuses. Status inflicting moves against enemies work based on enemy HP and are not random. Enemies can also have different turn modifiers for each status, making them last longer or shorter against them.<next>Each enemy has a certain maximum number of turns they can be statused, after which, it will become impossible to status them again. Enemies also become less susceptible the more turns they have been statused, proportional to their maximum status turns. <line><line>For example, an enemy with a maximum status turn count of 4 will become 25% less susceptible to all statuses for each turn of status inflicted against them.<line><line>Enemies can have moves that try to inflict statuses against you. You can block in order to halve the duration of the inflicted status, and the duration is rounded up unless the duration was 1. (with the status not being inflicted if the duration is reduced to 0.)"
Info_BuffDebuff,"Buffs, Debuffs and Tokens","Buffs, Debuffs and Tokens are temporary effects that can be applied in various ways.","Buffs, Debuffs and Tokens are temporary effects that can be applied in various ways. Buffs and Debuffs have duration and potency, while Tokens only have potency and they usually last indefinitely until certain conditions are met.<line><line>Unlike statuses, you can usually inflict an unlimited number of debuffs and negative tokens on enemies.<line><line>Like with statuses, enemies may have debuff inflicting moves, which you can reduce the duration of by blocking. You can also reduce the potency of negative tokens by blocking as well."
Info_BuffStacking,Buff Stacking,Attempting to apply a buff on a target that already has the same buff will cause the buff to have the potency of the stronger effect and a duration that is a certain amount longer than the stronger effect.,"Attempting to apply a buff on a target that already has the same buff will cause the buff to have the potency of the stronger effect and a duration that is a certain amount longer than the stronger effect.<line><line>More specifically, the duration is calculated in the following way.<line>Effect Power = Duration A * Potency A + Duration B * Potency B<line>New Duration = Effect Power / New Potency (rounded down).<next>However, you are guaranteed to get at least 1 bonus turn."
Info_BuffDebuffCancelling,Buff and Debuff Stacking,Attempting to apply a buff on a target that has an opposite debuff (or vice versa) will cause the effect to have the duration of the effect with a longer duration and a potency in between the two effects.,"Attempting to apply a buff on a target that has an opposite debuff (or vice versa) will cause the effect to have the duration of the effect with a longer duration and a potency in between the two effects.<line><line>More specifically, the potency is calculated in the following way (with Potency A and Duration A being the stronger effect)<line>New Potency = ((Duration A * Potency A) - (Duration B * Potency B)) / New Duration (rounded down)<next>However, stronger effect is guaranteed to be left with at least 1 potency."
Info_Berserk,Berserk,Berserk is a status that increases the target's attack by 1 but reduces their defense by 1. The target is also forced to target the one who inflicted the status.,"Berserk is a status that increases the target's attack by 1 but reduces their defense by 1. The target is also forced to target the one who inflicted the status. If this is not possible, they will target opponents normally. If an enemy inflicts you with Berserk, you will automatically use your base weapon move against it, or your base jump move if the weapon move can't be used.<next>However, if you become Berserk in some other way (or if you can't target the enemy that made you Berserk), you will alternate between using your base weapon move and your base jump move every other turn, targetting the frontmost target. In either case, you will block automatically while Berserk.<line><line>Berserk is the least useful status to inflict upon enemies, but it has some marginal usefulness if you want to make enemies target a specific character."
Info_Sleep,Sleep,Sleep is a status that prevents movement but causes the target to regenerate 10% of their Max HP every turn (clamped between 2 and 10 hp). Attacking a sleeping target wakes them up.,"Sleep is a status that prevents movement but causes the target to regenerate 10% of their Max HP every turn (clamped between 2 and 10 hp).

Info_LightDamage,Light Damage,"Light element is stronger against enemies at high hp, up to a 2x boost.","Light element is stronger against enemies at high hp, up to a 2x boost.<line><line>More specifically, the boost is a multiplier equal to (1 + (current hp / max hp)). Light damage is best used at the start of battle when all the enemies are at max hp.<line><line>If enemies are using light damage against you, you may want to avoid healing as long as possible in order to reduce the damage they deal."
